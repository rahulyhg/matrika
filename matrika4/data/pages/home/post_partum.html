    Food, Drink, Herbs and Locally Available Resources</h2>
These days <em>Dais</em> use a new blade to cut the cord, earlier they used an iron
knife heated over fine.&#8221; &#8211;Bihar
<br />
<br />
&#8220;Some examples of hot food and drink are a fine paste of garlic, curry leaves
and mustard seeds with rice (Andhra Pradesh), a spoonful of <em>ajwain</em> daily
helps food digestion or milk with <em>ghee</em>, <em>ahwain</em> and jaggery.&quot;
&#8211;Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;Sweet pudding (<em>Gur ka seera, dalia</em>) is given after childbirth. If
she desires, roti is given.&#8221; &#8211;Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;We give food after birth as this gives energy to the new mother, she will
have milk for the baby and will also not have stomach ache.&#8221; &#8211;Manohari,
Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;Sweet pudding is the first thing given to eat. Then warm drink of milk and
ghee. Woman is given sweet balls made out of edible gum (<em>gondh ki laddu</em>).
Spces or chilli are not given, nor is she allowed to have cold food.&quot; &#8211;
Manori, Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;We make the baby lick the blood of placenta. This keeps the baby from respiratory
problem.&quot; &#8211;Mohini, Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;Some women get the desired to eat mud after delivery. This urge may be because
of lack of blood. We advised them to have roasted black gram, lentils or nuts.&#8221;
&#8211; Punjab
<br />
<br />
&#8220;For the forty days, we tell the new mother to drink warm water.&#8221; &#8211;Punjab
<br />
<br />
&#8220;After delivery a woman is not given any grain or heavy food. This is called
<em>narak</em> fasting (<em>Narak</em> <em>Upwas</em> or fasting during the time
of <em>Narak</em>). Grain is only given on the third day after all the dirty blood
comes out. On the first day, she eats biscuits with tea. She drinks warm water.
Second day, heat-producing balls mage out of ginger, pepper, turmeric, roasted rice,
milk, jaggery (<em>saunth</em> balls). Third day, rice, lentil soup and vegetables
are given. Rice is not given immediately after birth. First, we massage her. This
relaxes her muscles, only after this she can digest her food. Turmeric lessens pain,
dries the <em>shareer</em> and the <em>saunth</em> helps in forming milk.&#8221;
&#8211;Pairia Devi, Bihar
<br />
<br />
&#8220;We give warm fomentation to woman&#8217;s vagina. Also warm pieces of brick
are kept in an earthen pot and placed on her belly. By this the bad blood melts
and comes out.&#8221; &#8211;Rani, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;When a <em>jachcha</em> gets <em>gola</em> pain (postpartum pain, the involution
of the uterus) a coconut is broken near the head of the<em> jachcha&#8217;s</em>
bed. A few pieces are given to jachcha to eat and the rest is distributed.&#8221;
&#8211;Praveen, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;The Dai massages the new mother for six days, foments her belly with arandi
leaves and tie her waist with cloth. She feeds the woman and gives her hot brew
of ajwain.&#8221; &#8211;Bihar
<br />
<br />
&#8220;A paste of turmeric, <em>ajwain</em> and neem leaves is used to massage her.
Her shareer is fumigated with Onion bhusi, garlic bhusi, loban and hair, these four
are burnt. She squats over this. This helps in healing her <em>shareer</em> and
helps get rid of the bad blood.&#8221; -Dhapo, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;The roots of wild berries bush (<em>baer</em>) is pounded and boiled. <em>Jachcha</em>
is made to sit in water. This helps contracting and cleaning the womb.&#8221; &#8211;Dhapo,
Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;Before we used to make the women lie on sand (<em>dhool</em>-<em>mitti</em>)
to deliver. If the woman felt cold, then I used to heat up the sand. Now, we are
given plastic sheets by Urmul. So we spread these sheets during birth.&#8221; &#8211;Manohari,

<h2>
    Skills and Knowledge</h2>
&#8220;If the baby is doing fine then we clean baby&#8217;s mouth with cotton or
cloth and place next to mother. By this mother and child feel secure and warm.&#8221;
&#8211;Punjab
<img src="/assets/images/herbal.jpg" width="300" height="211" class="floatRight" />
&#8220;The Dai massages <em>jachcha</em> from stomach to pelvic area, to facilitate
placenta delivery.&#8221; &#8211;Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;She may put a hair in <em>jachcha&#8217;s</em> mouth to make her gag. This
reflex action expels the placenta. Or an ash drink may be given to her.&#8221; &#8211;Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;To expel the placenta, the Dai massages the belly, and may get the woman
to gag putting the new mother&#8217;s hair in her mouth.&#8221; &#8211;Bihar
<br />
<br />
&#8220;There are also ways to help placenta to come out. We press the belly and
massage it in circles. This it comes out.&#8221; &#8211;Tara, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;After birth, if the placenta doesn&#8217;t come straight out in the passage,
it gets stuck in the empty womb and takes time comes. Then we make the women cough.&#8221;
&#8211;Guddi, Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;After birth of the baby, the <em>Dai</em> presses the stomach from above.
This prevents the placenta from moving up.&#8221; &#8211;Bihar
<br />
<br />
&#8220;We cut the chord only after the placenta is delivered and after the baby
has cried. If cord is cut before placenta is out, it is dangerous because the placenta
may go up.&#8221; &#8211;Bihar
<br />
<br />
&#8220;Placenta is poisonous for the woman if it stays in her body. If it goes up
in the belly the woman can die.&#8221; &#8211;Punjab
<br />
<br />
&#8220;I consider cutting the cord a sin equal to killing of a 100 cows. I have
delivered many babies but have cut only 12 cords &#8211; of my own 12 children.
I always make the jachcha cut her own cord.&#8221; -Dhapo, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;It is my job to cut the cord. However, I do not cut cord of babies whoa re
related to me. They are my own blood. The cords of these babies are like my roots,
so how can I cut my own root? I handle their births but someone else cuts the cord.&#8221;
&#8211;Satwant Kaur, Punjab
<br />
<br />
&#8220;When a Dai cuts the cord, she offers something to the Gods.&#8221; &#8211;Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;Placenta-cord is buried in the house and fire is lit near it to ward off
evil spirits (<em>bhoot-pret</em>).&#8221; &#8211;Rani, delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;We never throw the placenta away. The child is so dear to us is the placenta
dear to us. For nine months it has nurtured and protected the baby so how can we
throw it? &#8211;kamala, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;The woman who does not have children is made to touch the placenta, this
helps her to have a baby.&#8221; &#8211;Praveen, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;After the placenta-cord is out, the vaginal area is pressed with the heel.
By this energy channels that gets pulled (<em>charhi hui nasein</em>) settle down.&#8221;
-Naseem, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;Dai cleans mouth throat of baby, and then using her finger dipped n oil cleans
the anal passages.&#8221; &#8211;Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;After birth, we bathe the baby with warm water prepared by boiling fenugreek
seeds. Ajwain is burnt in their room. The smoke is considered to be disinfectant.&#8221;
&#8211;Punjab
<br />
<br />
&#8220;The womb cannot settle immediately. Slowly it contracts and after 40 days
it closes completely.&#8221; -Rani, Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;Her pelvic area is pushed firmly, using the heel of the foot. This is done
for sometime everyday for the next few days, following birth.&#8221; &#8211;Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;We make the women stand and the press the jachcha&#8217;s belly with our
head to help expel blood. This is black blood. This way the nine months pooled blood
(<em>nau mahine ka narak</em>) is expelled. This flattens her belly. Otherwise,
the belly looks swollen as if there is baby inside. Bleeding also continues for
month or months and half. If the black blood is expelled then bleeding stops in
three-four days.&#8221; &#8211;Kheevni, Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
It is called dirty blood because it has collected over nine months in the body.
It is dark, smelly and clotted. It comes out first and then fresh clean blood comes
out. With a little pressure and massage and press the stomach to place the stomach
back into position.&#8221; &#8211;Punjab
<br />
<br />
&#8220;For 5 days we go to <em>jachcha&#8217;s</em> house everyday. Massage her
head with ghee and pepper. Her head stays cool. Massage her body with oil and give
warm antiseptic herbal bath (boil <em>raangh ki jar</em>, roots of wild bush). This
cleans her and keeps her from falling ill.&#8221; -Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;The mother is cleaned up, her blood stained cloth changed, her hands and
face washed. Her belly is given hot fomentation by placing earthen pot on a leaf.
Her back is pressed gently with feet. Then she is asked to sleep.&#8221; &#8211;Bihar
<br />
<br />
&#8220;The baby is bathed and wiped, dressed and may be placed next to the mother
at this point. The baby may be given lick of honey or jaggery, or may be placed
at the breast immediately. Dais are from various communities (Rajasthan, Punjab,
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh), and so are their clients. Often the Dai is
from the same community, but not always. If she is from a different community, she
is sensitive to their customs and respects their practices regarding breast-feeding.&#8221;
&#8211;Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;Both mother and baby are massaged. In most places, the stomach is massaged
gently with the purpose of helping the uterus come back into its original shape
and place, and aid removal of blood from the womb. The naval is pressed to help
settle the uterus. The legs may be massaged forcefully, because the woman&#8217;s
legs tend to become weak after childbirth.&#8221; &#8211;Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;We take <em>ghee</em> or mustard oil and massage legs, knee and feet. We
massage in upward direction, from feet to the thighs. We massage the head with warm
oil. She should not catch cold. Massage helps in the circulation of blood. One should
wait for 1-2 hours before having a bath.&#8221; &#8211;Punjab
<br />
<br />
&#8220;We massage only the head because if there is tension in the head, there is
tension in the whole body. If there is peace in the head, there is peace in the
whole body. If the head is cool the whole body is cool.&#8221; &#8211;Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;If the birth takes long then the baby&#8217;s head becomes long, it gets
exposed to air. Wee massage the head of the baby and set the bones. During this
time the head is soft and gently.&#8221; &#8211;Punjab
<br />
<br />
&#8220;Massage makes the body light and relieves fatigue. Without massage, the woman
cannot become active. It helps firm up the muscles.&#8221; &#8211;Punjab
<br />
<br />
&#8220;If she has itching in her vagina (<em>shareer</em>) we give fumigation of
vagina. We burn some of her hair and herb (<em>bhojpath</em>). This stops the itching.&#8221;
&#8211;Manori, Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;The <em>shareer</em> is <em>kachcha</em> at this time. First we massage the
head and once it cools down then the bode relaxes. Afterwards the whole body is
massaged. This is done from the fourth day when the bleeding lessens.&#8221; &#8211;Kheevni,
Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;her shareer is cleaned with warm herbal water (<em>raangh ki jar</em>). This
prevents infection. It is done for three-four days.&quot;-Kheevni, Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;This is a gola of thick, coagulated blood (jamma hua khoon). It bleeds out
in three days and then abdomen feels better.&#8221; Guddi, Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;<em>Gola</em> is the protector of the baby. When the baby comes out it looks
around for the baby. Therefore there is pain. When it doesn&#8217;t find the baby
it settles down on its own.&#8221; &#8211;Praveen, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;<em>Gola</em> is baby&#8217;s home. When the house becomes empty, only dirty
blood is left. When this comes out there is pain. Hot brew (<em>ajwain</em>, <em>aunth</em>,
<em>papal</em> and <em>gur</em>) is given. This drink cleans the belly. After the
baby is born. The gola roams around. This gola has taken care of the baby, now must
leave. If the pain in intense then warm fomentation is done and gola melts away.
This is dirty blood and needs cleaning up.&#8221; &#8211;Kamala, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;When the <em>gola</em> moves the pains are excruciating as if the life force
is ebbing away (pran nikal jata hai). The place from where it moves is pressed.
Then it stays on the lower part of the abdomen.&#8221; &#8211;Dhapo, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;We tie the belly and press the <em>gola</em>. This is more difficult then
handling a delivery. If there is lot of pain then hot fomentation of gola is done.
We place a warm metal pot containing pieces of warm bricks on the abdomen.&#8221;
&#8211;Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;After the baby is delivered I move the belly of the woman in circles a lot.
When it is set the gola comes out. It is to be done very skillfully.&#8221; &#8211;Tara,
delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;If wind/air (<em>hawa</em>) goes inside then it makes lot of funny sounds.
Therefore no air should be allowed to go inside the body. For then days massage
is done for the jachcha thn no air will go in her body and she will not have joint
pains.&#8221; &#8211;Kamala
<br />
<br />
&#8220;After birth the <em>Dai</em> makes the jachcha cross her legs, one leg is
put on the other. This is to prevent air from entering her body.&#8221; &#8211;Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;The jachcha is told to cross her legs. For at least tow days, she should
keep her legs crossed most of the time. She should not get up and walk about, as
wind would then form inside her body.&#8221; Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;If the information is done with ajwain pouches the air does not effect the
woman. Her shareer does not itch.&#8221; &#8211;Tara, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;With a wet mixture of flour, turmeric powder, ghee, the new mother is massaged.
The baby is bathed with warm water. We make her sit ina tub of herbal antiseptic
water prepared by boiling raangh ki jhar. This is done for 2-3 days. This heals
and also helps in closing of the shareer.&#8221; &#8211;Kesari, Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;Sometimes the cord is crushed and given to drink to a woman who is not able
to conceive. Then her womb starts functioning.&#8221; &#8211;Rukma, Rajasthan

<h2>
    Emotional and Social Support</h2>
&#8220;We do not tell the <em>jachcha</em> the sex of the child till the placenta
is delivered. If the woman has had few girls children and is wanting a boy child,
she may go in shock hearing that she has given birth to a girl child.&#8221; &#8211;Prema,
Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;We do not tell the woman the sex of the child, she can get a shock. This
may cause the placenta to go up and cause death. We try to remain calm and also
keep the woman calm. This may happen even when she gets excited on having a boy
child. We do not even tell the family members about it. It is only after the placenta
is out and cord is cut that we inform the new mother and the family members.&#8221;
&#8211;Kako, Punjab
<br />
<br />
&#8220;Some jachcha die if they keep on having girl babies. It happened with me.
One woman had a third girl baby. Her younger sister-in-law said,&#8217;O, dear!
A girl baby is born&#8217;. I told her to keep quite or else something bad could
happen with the mother. After a while she satarted bleeding heavily, quickly she
was taken to the hospital. She died there. I was so upset that for many days I could
not go for deliveries. For two years, I did not talk to that family. I could have
also got a bad name. many times we also lie that she has got a boy baby.&#8221;
&#8211;Vidya Devi, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;We understand the apin of another woman&#8217;s body, adhnar pain (<em>gola</em>
referred as adhnar in Bihar) by our own experience of what happens in our own body.
In me, too, adhnar roamed around, I had pains therefore I can understand what happens
in anotehr&#8217;s body. We call the blood clots which come out when we press her
belly &#8216;<em>Gangi-jamni</em>&#8217;. After it comes out the body feels better
and pain becomes less.&#8221; &#8211;Jetli, Bihar
<br />
<br />
&#8220;Till jachcha has a bath, the baby is not named nor is any prayer or rituals
done. The jachcha is considered unclean (<em>chhutak</em>). On the fortieth day,
the earthen pots are changed, the new mother is bathed and her room is cleaned.
Till now only <em>Dai</em> was touching het and taking care. Nobody from the house
was touching her. The <em>Dai</em> massages the new mother and the new baby. There
is a tradition to use wheat grain flour, ghee and turmeric for massage. This softens
jachcha&#8217;s skin and her skin glows like that of new bride.&#8221; &#8211;Kheevni,
Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;A woman should rest for several days after delivery. However, this depends
on her condition and the requitements of her household. She needs to rest, as her
body is closing up gradually.&#8221; &#8211;Bihar
<br />
<br />
&#8220;A woman should rest for at least forty days. Her shareer is raw, so she resumes
work gradually.&#8221; &#8211;Rukma, Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;A <em>Dai</em> advises the mother to rest as much as she can.&#8221; &#8211;Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;If a woman does heavy work after delivery her uterus may come out. She should
rest till her shareer closes. People blame us whaen this happens although it is
really lack of rest. Then they ask us to set the uterus right!&#8221; &#8211;Saubatia,
Bihar
<br />
<br />
&#8220;After birth, asafoetida (<em>hing</em>) is put in apiece of cloth and tied
on jachcha&#8217;s cot. Matchstick, water and sickle are kept under the bed. This
is to protect the mother from fearful thoughts and feelings.&#8221; &#8211;Punjab</p>

    Rituals and Body Imagery</h2>
<img src="/assets/images/image005-c.jpg" width="350" height="293" class="floatRight" />&#8220;After
the birth we clean up, bathe the jachcha, beat the thaali to announce the birth
to others and go home.&#8221; &#8211; Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;The placenta-cord is buried. We also bury rice, sweets, turmeric and money
along with it. We pray to Mother Earth to receive the dirty stuff.&#8221; &#8211;Punjab
<br />
<br />
&#8220;The placenta-cord is buried in the house and fire is lit near it-to ward
off malevolent spirits and ghosts.&#8221; &#8211;Rani, Bihar
<br />
<br />
&#8220;We take lot of care while burying in the house the placenta. Along with the
placenta we bury red powder (<em>kumkum</em>) money, grain, jaggery and a ring.
We bury it in a side down position the baby will vomit. The baby can fall ill. However,
the placenta cord must be kept very safely.&#8221; &#8211;Kesari Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;After birth, baby is put to the brest. The first milk is given under the
coolness of the srtars. A ring is put on the nipple and milk is taken out in a plate.
The younger-sister-in-law (<em>nanad</em>) cleans the breast and then the baby is
given to sickle. Sister-in-law is given the ritual gift or money.&#8221; Kesari,
Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&#8220;It used to be that the younger sister-in-law would clean the breast with
grass. After that the baby would be put to the breast. These days we ourselves clean
it.&#8221; &#8211;Tara, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&#8220;The baby was given first milk under the coolness of the stars. Eight drops
of milk were given initially. If the birth takes place in the morning then the milk
is given in the evening after the stars come out.&#8221; &#8211;Manohari, Rajasthan

&#8220;The Dai goes to her own home soon after the delivery. She comes regularly
every day for the next few days. She takes care of the mother and child foe about
6 days. Then, birth a new baby is celebrated (<em>chhati</em>). On this day the
Narak time ends. The bleeding of the new mother and the child is removed and the
<em>Dai</em> cleans the room wher the birth took place. The dirty clothes of the
mother and baby are also cleaned. After this soap and oil is given to Dai, she takes
a bath. The Dai is given a ritual gift or money (<em>neg</em>). the relatives of
new mother and father meet (<em>samdhi</em> <em>Milan</em>). The house is cleaned
and decorated, mother and baby wear new clothes. She puts on her marks of beauty
(<em>applies sindor and khol</em>).&#8221; &#8211;Bihar
<br />
<br />
&#8220;On the 13th day after birth, the new mother is allowed to enter the kitechen.
(<em>chauka</em> <em>charhana</em>) Some do it on 7th or 11th day. Everybody celebrates.
There is singing and dancing. On this day the new mother and the baby bathe and
wear new clothes. She comes out to get everyone&#8217;s blessing. Friends and relatives
are invited and eat food together. The <em>Dai</em> is given clothes, food and grain.&#8221;

<br />
&#8220;On the day of the birth ritual celebration (<em>chhati</em>-6th day) the
woman wears everything that was taken off at the home of the birth. She put on bindi,
bangles, henna and nose ring. We make rirual drawings of Swastik, worship Bemata
and light a lamp. We make a foot impression of the mother on the floor and then
the women enters the main house. Till the 5th day Bemata roams around in the house.
The Dai also goes to serve others.&#8221; &#8211;Paana, Rajasthan
