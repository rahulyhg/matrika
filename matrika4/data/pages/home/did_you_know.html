    The vagina, the entry to the womb, is most often represented in today’s world in
    dry, schematic biomedical parlance, or in gross, often exploitative pornography.
    Increasingly women are reclaiming this part of our bodies in terms of our own pleasure
    and fertility. Here we offer imagings of the opening from which babies emerge.<br />
    <br />
    The root of ‘yoni’ is the Sanskrit word ‘yuj’ meaning ‘to unite’. The yoni is the
    crucible where things are combined (male and female, mother and fetus)—where creation
    and re-creation takes place. Where the unseen (not perceptible to the senses) world
    takes material form.<br />
    <br />
    The yoni is also the place where each menstruating woman, may within her body, experience
    the cosmic cycles of creation sustenance and destruction. Each month the egg is
    released by the ovary, finds its way through the fallopian tube, and may or may
    not be fertilized, the birth, life and death of an egg cell.<br />
    <br />
    Yoni signifies both vagina and womb. In the traditional cosmo-vision it is where
    the spirit world (or the unborn, the ancestors) meet the flesh-and-blood reality
    of the material world.<br />
