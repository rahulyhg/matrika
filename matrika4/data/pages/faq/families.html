        What of dais&#8217; knowledge and practice is relevant or can help me with my pregnancy,
        birth and postpartum?
    </h2>
    The first thing to remember is that if you are reading this, you are in a very different
    situation than the women that dais served in the past, or even now. You will see
    in the database presented on this website that dais supported women in many ways&#8212;dietary,
    ritual, massage, herbal&#8212;and you might pick and chose among these which are
    relevant, available and appeal to you.
    <br />
    <br />
    Perhaps most important about traditional ways was that dais and women believed that
    the female body (with help from the dai, female relatives, the spirit world, herbs,
    etc.) had the power, the shakti, to birth a baby. We, in our technology-dominated
    world, have lost that belief, and the rituals which support that belief. Rituals
    and visualizations congruent with a woman&#8217;s beliefs and spiritual life can
    be part of a birth &#8216;plan&#8217;.<br />

    <h2>
        Aren&#8217;t dais&#8217; ways unscientific?</h2>
    It all depends on what you mean by &#8216;science&#8217;. Traditional methods of
    birthing have not been tested by randomized, double blind, controlled trials, as
    often pharmaceuticals have been. They have, however, been tested by time. The best
    of the dai tradition is also compatible with Yoga, Tantra, Ayurveda and other Asian
    medical systems.<br />
    <br />
    Procedures like enema, shaving the pubic area, denial of food and restricted movement
    during labour, were all introduced into India from the west&#8212;and they were
    thought to be modern and scientific. Now, however, in the west they considered not
    &#8216;evidence-based and are pass&#233;, understood to cause more harm than good.
    And are experienced as painful and oppressive by many women.<br />
    <br />
    <h2>
        What if my obstetrician objects?
    </h2>
    Finding an obstetrician who is both skilled in bio-medical terms, and also open
    to women birthing in a manner they choose is a challenging task. Increasingly medical
    doctors are aware of the value of complementary and alternative systems of medicine
    in areas like heart disease, diabetes, etc. In obstetrics however, not much information
    is available to doctors in the Indian context. So a pregnant woman needs to do her
    homework. What, specifically does the doctor object to and why? What evidence (doctors
    are supposedly very keen on &#8216;evidence-based&#8217; medicine) can you present
    to speak to her concerns? You can educate yourself about procedures and their rationales
    and pick the issues which are important to you.
    <br />
    <br />
    It is also essential that your husband and family or friends, who are going to be
    involved, support you in what you are trying to do. They too must be made aware
    that all medical interventions, even though in emergencies they may be life saving,
    have negative side effects on you and the baby. Too often small procedures, such
    as a sedative injection, will result in slowing down labour pains, requiring pitocin
    to stimulate the contractions&#8212;which if it is not effective in opening the
    cervix will result in fetal distress, which necessitates a caesarian section!
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>
        How does one combine indigenous and modern medicine?
    </h2>
    It is not easy to combine tradition with modern medicine in the Indian context.
    Doctors are respected caregivers and exercise absolute power in their domain, the
    hospital or nursing home. Their education has prepared them to practice obstetrics
    and not realize its limitations, nor appreciate traditional or complementary medicine.
    <br />
    <br />
    Likewise there are so many pieces of advice from aunties and grandmothers&#8212;one
    does not know what is valuable and what is not. Local health traditions are different
    in different areas&#8212;for example in mountain areas the oil-massage so common
    in the plains is not practiced, perhaps because of the climate. It is important
    to try to understand the rationale behind the practice and then evaluate it from
    one&#8217;s own point of view. Much of traditional body knowledge is non-medical,
    preventative and health promoting, not simply curative. The pregnant woman can exercise
    maximum control over her lifestyle before she goes into labour. She can care for
    herself, ensuring a healthy body through exercise, diet and maintaining emotional
    balance.<br />
    <br />
    Traditionally women always said that swabbing the floor in a squatting position
    and using a traditional toilet are excellent for a pregnant woman&#8212;and they
    are right. However this activity can be updated by the modern woman, squatting whenever
    possible and following an exercise regimen. Walking throughout the pregnancy is
    highly recommended. Yoga and meditation are invaluable during pregnancy, not only
    helping maintain emotional equilibrium, but also energizing the body with prana&#8212;the
    life force energy.<br />

    <h2>
        What can be used in the hospital/nursing home?
    </h2>
    Dais give &#8216;heating&#8217; substances to stimulate the metabolism and strengthen
    contractions. Sipping a herbal concoction may be allowed by your doctor during labour.
    In many areas a postpartum preparation is made of gur, ajwain and other ingredients.
    One Bihari nurse referred to this as &#8216;desi antibiotics&#8217;. Punjabis call
    it &#8216;panjiri&#8217;. It helps cleansing the body postpartum, is a prophylactic
    against infection and aids milk production.<br />
    <br />
    Dais also use the subtle power of rituals, especially with the first stage of labour.
    Throughout India rituals of opening are performed to facilitate the birth. The cervix
    has to open in order for the baby to emerge, this opening&#8212;which takes place
    inside the mother&#8217;s body (dais use the term andar ka sharir&#8212;literally
    the inside body) is helped by mimicking that inner process in the outside world.
    Doors, windows, locks, knots are all opened by the mother. Her hair is let loose,
    bangles, other jewelry, bindi are all removed&#8212;signifying permission for the
    mother to move from social convention to the &#8216;wild&#8217; pure bodily energetic
    space, unrestrained.<br />
    <br />
    Women today could do this opening ritual before leaving for the hospital/nursing
    home, but their situation is quite different&#8212;they usually would not have the
    support of a family or friends who believed that such rituals could be effective.
    If done today it would be important to perform these actions in a prayerful manner,
    invoking whatever powers, deities, energies one is accustomed to&#8212;be they conventional
    religious figures, Reiki or Pranic Healing, personal deities (Ishta Deva) or simply
    Mother Nature as she works through the hormonal actions of the female body.<br />
