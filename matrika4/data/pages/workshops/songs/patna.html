                no one will step in them. They say there are seven types of pox and that&#8217;s

            <span class="default4">My interpretation of this song must be contextutalized by the
                workshop in which I heard it.</span></p>
        <p class="default4">
            I am struck by the mirroring between the parallel between the mayas&#8217; activity
            and the women&#8217;s activity; both the goddesses and the women are singing. Identities
            of goddesses and women, in terms of expressive and joyous action are collapsed.</p>
        <p class="default4">
            Time, rhythm the mayas are swinging in a jula, strung from a neem tree. Not just
            mythic or historical time, but time is marked by the processes and needs of the
            body; the female body. In this case the thirst, the desire for water of the mayas.</p>
        <p class="default4">
            I would suggest that the malin is responsive to the bodily desire (and timings)
            of the mayas, just as the dai is responsive to the needs (and timings) of the woman
            in labour. Water, blessings</p>
        <p class="default4">
            <br />
            Maya means attachment, compassion, affection<br />
            Within family life this word is used (like Mamta)</p>
        <p class="default4">
            In philosophical sense maya is illusion, often Hindus say &#8220;moha maya ki jal&#8221;,
            and the aim of religious practice is to escape this trap of affection. Many have
            never heard maya said in a positive way!</p>
        <p class="default4">
            Female infanticide &#8211; in Bihar, where female infanticide has begun to be practiced
            by the dais, I recorded the above song &#8211; where blessings are bestowed by the
            Satto Mayas upon the daughter and daughter-in-law &#8211; that they may live well.</p>
        <p class="default4">
            In the urban elite discourse, female infanticide is seen as a barbaric and primitive
            practice &#8211; a part of traditional ignorance and immorality. And yet the dais
            sing songs which valorise the well being of the daughter and daughter-in-law. This
            tends to substantiate the contention that it is modernization and not tradition,
            in this area, which leads to infanticide. Modernization and caste (not midwifery)
            are responsible for this extreme gender bias. The NGO acknowledged that this was
            a Rajput and Brahmin practice (dowry and infanticide) and that only now it is trickling
            down to lower castes.</p>
        <p class="default4">
            Maya discussions</p>
        <p class="default4">
            Ironically, the women whom I&#8217;ve talked to seem to identify with maya, in its
            negative sense &#8211; illusion, temptress, dangerous and seductive sexuality. Men,
            perhaps identify maya with nurturing, attractive and wise corporeality, physicality
            of women as mothers/wives/sexual partners/affectionate sisters/wise embodied older
            women and cherish these human embodiments of maya.

        <p class="default4">
            With Vidya</p>
        <p class="default4">
            Maya linked with Maiya (mother). Women singers are negotiating and making statements.
            In singing these words the sounds are blurred. As a singer I would play with a blurring
            of these sounds.</p>
        <p class="default4">
            Maya means choosing incarnation &#8211; willing acceptance of embodiment, can learn
            these lessons only in a body.</p>
        <p class="default4">
            Last canto of the Gita Govinda voice of a woman who has been loved and loved, voice
            of the self (ungendered), lovingly known non-duality, now accepts the separation
            of the body (?) the experience of life (?) clarification. Just before this part
            woman says don&#8217;t come to me with lies. She is hurt and unhappy, jealousy (maya
            has been played out &#8211; there is no distance). She has an angry resignation
            &#8211; don&#8217;t talk to me. Krishna says and asks for forgiveness, as a mark
            of that forgiveness says &#8220;place your lotus feet on my head&#8221;. She says
            with your hands cooler than sandalwood braid my hair (her braid has come undone).
            Apply my kajal (her kajal has been smeared). She delights in her own body in this
            act of recomposure and entry in to the world again.</p>
        <p class="default4">
            Kabir I know that maya is a thing (feminine) the great deceitful one???</p>
        <p class="default4">
            Attachment, moh maya, entrapment, Therighat, songs of the sisters, stuff of ideology
            rejection of attachment, turn away from the bond with the child to renunciation.
            Interpretation? Who writes and inscribes these ideas &#8211; passes them on? Packed
            with ideology, also creates (?) options alternatives for women. Problem is how do
            we read this stuff. Are they misogynist? Yes. Were they ideological? We have no
            way of knowing &#8211; problem of interpretation. Gautama the Buddha as kshatriya
            &#8211; warrior &#8211; approach of the practitioner (as that scientist Buddhist
            said?) or liberation theology interpretation of questioning emerging caste, gender
            and state power hierarchies. Uma Chak.</p>
        <p class="default4">
            Vidya &#8211; ramana maharishi answered no I&#8217;m not an advaitin. What is is
            beyond the duality of duality and non/duality &#8211; the only way to know this
            is to live through it.</p>
        <p class="default4">
            Notion of completeness, non-duality, birth (childbirth) notion of life as flawed
            and limited.</p>
        <p class="default4">
            I can&#8217;t be myself and Janet &#8211; but by being myself in life, etc enjoying
            maya, I do play with myself as finite, limited, -- whether in suffering or in joy.
            I am also you, can only see that if I&#8217;m born. Birth pains, there is pain,
            it is purposeful, carries within itself a different connotation than headache.</p>
        <p class="default4">
            With maya moksha in Gita Govinda, Kabir, fluidity, no boundaries or hierarchies.
            This is also not, strictly speaking, conflicting or competing oppositional forces,
            but rather complementary and interpenetrating oppositions: embodiment and the other
            realms &#8211; can be accessed through aesthetic, narrative traditions &#8211; in
            philosophy and religion more delineated as hierarchical.
