                        <li class="default">The <em>dai</em> comes whenever she is called -- be it day or night,
                            has no fixed times (like nurse or doctor).</li>
                        <li class="default">When she arrives, she washes her hands.</li>
                        <li class="default">She feels the stomach, if it is hard there is still time for birth,
                            if soft the baby is due soon.</li>
                        <li class="default">She sees how much the cervix has opened.</li>
                        <li class="default">sees whether or not the baby has moved down.</li>
                        <li class="default">Some <em>dais</em> tell the woman to have a bath, some do not. She
                            washes the woman&apos;s hands and feet.</li>
                        <li class="default">If the baby is due soon the <em>dai </em>begins to massage the stomach
                            with oil <em>(sontna)</em>.</li>
                        <li class="default">She presses the hands and feet.</li>
                        <li class="default">The <em>dai</em> checks the position of the baby by pouring oil
                            on the prasauti&apos;s navel. If it falls straight, the baby is straight, if it
                            falls <em>terha</em> (crooked or transverse), the baby is <em>terha</em>.</li>
                        <li class="default">The <em>dai </em>keeps oil near the bed.</li>
                        <li class="default">If there is discharge of water and a little blood there is no cause
                            for concern.</li>
                        <li class="default">If the bag of water bursts, but pains are not speeding up, the <em>
                            dai </em>gives her milkless tea, or warm saline water, to drink.</li>
                        <li class="default">The <em>dai</em> gives hot fomentation, by placing heated coal below
                            waist area, wrapped in cloth.</li>
                        <li class="default"><em>Dai</em> gives tea or kaarha to drink, and feeds the <em>prasauti</em>
                            `hot&apos; foods like <em>khichri</em> so she gets strength to push. </li>
                        <li class="default">Some <em>dais</em> said if the cervix is not dilated after 12 hours
                            of labour, the <em>jacha</em> is taken to the doctor (however this seems to be true
                            in theory more than practice, since a number of <em>dais</em> report never having
                            sent a woman to the doctor). Other <em>dais</em> said that if labour is prolonged
                            over five days, then there is cause for concern. The dais all are aware that the
                            first child often takes a long time, but the next ones are born quicker.</li>
                        <li class="default"><em>Dais</em> facilitate birth by requesting that all knots, locks,
                            boxes in the room are opened up.</li>
                        <li class="default">The dai may facilitate birth by calling in a relative who may have
                            had some conflict with the birthing woman (&quot;The dai asked me to come and sit
                            in the room when my <em>bhabi</em> was giving birth, the birth was delayed but after
                            I came in the baby came quickly... The <em>dai </em>said she must have been hiding
                            something from me...&quot;: Saroja. Or, the <em>saas</em>&#8217; toe is dipped in
                            water and the <em>prasauti </em>has to drink that water....). [This may be interpreted
                            as an `untying of knots&apos; at an emotional/psychological level.]</li>
                        <li class="default">If labour is continuing for long, the <em>dai </em>or a family member
                            draws water from the well with one hand, keeps it in a bowl <em>(katori)</em>. The
                            <em>ojha</em> -- medicine-man -- is called. First he sends water, often after drinking
                            this the woman gets her labour pains. If not, he is sent for, he comes and blows
                            a mantra meaning `go, go&apos; to the evil spirit that is obstructing the birth.
                            He mixes water, salt and mud with his left hand and gives the paste to the <em>prasauti</em>
                            to drink. The <em>nanad</em> is made to knock at the door 5 times, and told to draw
                            5 parallel lines on the mud of the threshold;<em> saas</em> is told to put water
                            and mud in water pot, dip her foot in this, and the <em>prasauti</em> has to drink
                            it.</li>
                        <li class="default">Water may be poured over <em>dehri</em> (threshold) and collected.
                            Saas dips her finger in it and <em>prasauti</em> drinks it.</li>
                        <li class="default">Latalatiya grass and other herbs may be put in her hair.</li>
                        <li class="default"><em>Dai</em> prays to the devi, to God, to <em>Dharti Ma</em>, <em>
                            Durga Ma</em>: requesting their support at this time.</li>
                        <li class="default">The women of the house also do puja and pray.</li>
                        <li class="default">Some <em>dais</em> take the name of their own <em>peehar</em> (natal
                            home).</li>
                        <li class="default">If evil eye (<em>nazar</em>) has been cast, they abuse the <em>dayan</em>
                            so as to ward off the evil eye (abuses such as <em>saali</em>, <em>haramzadi,</em>
                            <em>randi</em>).</li>
                        <li class="default"><em>Parsad</em> (sacred food offering) is offered.</li>
                        <li class="default">The <em>dai </em>deals lovingly with the <em>prasauti</em> (&quot;She
                            explains affectionately, tells us to take strength, to push only when she tells
                            us...).</li>
                        <li class="default">The <em>dai</em> may put in her hand to feel the mouth of the womb,
                            also the `balloon&apos; (amniotic sac?), to determine whether it&apos;s time for
                            delivery.<br />

                        <li class="default">Only when &quot;the child is ready to come out&quot;, the <em>dai</em>
                            tells her to push. </li>
                        <li class="default">Many <em>dais</em> put in hand to see when pains are <em>pukka</em>
                            (hard contractions).</li>
                        <li class="default">The <em>dai </em>presses the amniotic sac, which doubles in size
                            when the pains are faster, and bursts -- as the sac slips out, so does the baby.</li>
                        <li class="default">Some <em>dais</em> observe the woman begins to sweat, just before
                            labour pains.</li>
                        <li class="default">When birth begins the dai uses her hands -- to put oil, water, massage
                            the perineum.</li>
                        <li class="default">She tells her to sit, one person holds her from the back, <em>dai</em>
                            supports from front. The woman is asked to lie down only if there is a lot of difficulty.</li>
                        <li class="default">If the woman is made to lie down, it is in a direction along the
                            direction of the beam of the house, lengthwise.</li>
                        <li class="default">The <em>dai </em>sometimes pushes alongwith the <em>prasauti</em>.</li>
                        <li class="default">&quot;The main word used by the dais is <em>dhire</em>, <em>dhire</em>,
                            <em>dhire</em>, <em>dhire</em>...&quot; (Andrienne, a Matrika member).</li>
                        <li class="default"><em>Dais</em> are conscious that during delivery their nails should
                            not touch the <em>prasauti&apos;s </em>body. </li>
                        <li class="default">They see to it that coal is not burnt near the woman, because it
                            is believed that if she sees smoke from burning coal during her delivery, the child
                            would develop epilepsy.</li>
                        <li class="default">The <em>dai </em>salutes (does <em>pranam </em>to) <em>Dharti Ma</em>,
                            for it is believed that it is the earth that is giving birth to the child. The saas
                            too will pray. (&quot;<em>Dharti Ma</em> is like a mother. Like a mother gives birth,
                            the Earth also gives birth. We pray to Dharti Ma by touching the Earth with our
                            hands, and do puja and keep her in our minds.</li>
                        <li class="default">If the <em>prasauti </em>screams, the <em>dai</em> tells her not
                            to, because everyone will hear, including <em>sasur</em> (father-in-law) and neighbours.
                            The saas may even slap the <em>prasauti</em>. Both dai and saas explain to her that
                            she should use her strength and it is good she is at home (&quot;at home no one
                            will see, if you had been in hospital the doctor would hang up your legs and hands
                            and see everything.&quot;)</li>
                        <li class="default">If the woman is not pushing the <em>dai</em> speaks to her, coaxes,
                            even threatens and scares her, gives her a drink.</li>
                        <li class="default">The <em>dai</em> may do <em>maalish</em>, press her feet against
                            the <em>prasauti&apos;s </em>buttocks<em> </em>and ask her to push, saying &quot;It
                            will get born, use your strength...&quot;.</li>
                        <li class="default">The baby&apos;s head moves down, and birth takes place.</li>
                        <li class="default">If the baby is not moving down, the <em>dai </em>may pull with her
                            hand. However, most dais said they do not use their hands to pull, rather they let
                            the baby come out on its own.</li>
                        <li class="default">There are reports of women birthing on their own, without a <em>
                            dai </em>even. (Lisa&apos;s experience of being present when a woman gave birth
                            in a railway compartment, and Lisa had to help by cutting the cord....Another woman
                            said, &quot;My <em>mami </em>has her children all by herself.&quot;).<br />

                    <ol type="a">
                        <li class="default">After birth of the baby the placenta is to be delivered. The <em>
                            dai</em> keeps the stomach pressed to prevent placenta from moving up.</li>
                        <li class="default">To facilitate delivery of the placenta, the <em>dai </em>does massage,
                            and may get the woman to gag (with hair in her mouth). She may even put in her hand
                            and pull it out. [This was criticised by the NGO worker as often the placenta is
                            pulled too hard. Similarly, massage is sometimes too hard.]</li>
                        <li class="default">If the baby is not active or does not cry then the <em>dai</em>
                            rubs the cord, placing a coin or rice grain underneath it. By rubbing, heat passes
                            to the baby. The baby often revives. This resuscitation may also be done by rubbing
                            the navel, and burning the placenta in a fire.</li>
                        <li class="default">The cord is cut only after placenta delivery, and after the child
                            cries. If cord is cut before placenta is out it is harmful for the <em>prasauti</em>,
                            because the placenta (phool) may go up and affect the liver. </li>
                        <li class="default">Nowadays <em>dais</em> use a new sterilised blade to cut the cord,
                            while earlier they used an iron knife heated over fire.</li>
                        <li class="default">The <em>dai</em> makes the <em>prasauti </em>stand against a wall
                            with her arms stretched upwards, then the <em>dai</em> puts her head hard against
                            the <em>prasauti&apos;s </em>stomach, to help all the blood come out. </li>
                        <li class="default">The child is shown to the father. He gives <em>rasm</em> (ritual
                            gift/money) to the dai.</li>
                        <li class="default">The baby is cleaned, bathed (or water sprinkled on), wrapped up,
                            baby&apos;s tongue is pressed so that he will talk, then fed milk with deer-antler
                            powder rubbed in it; or goat&apos;s milk administered with a cloth; or garlic.</li>
                        <li class="default">The mother is cleaned up, her blood-stained clothes changed, her
                            hands and face washed, given hot fomentation by placing a <em>kulhar</em> on a leaf,
                            on the stomach. She is then allowed to sleep. Her back is pressed with feet. The
                            baby may be given in her lap.</li>
                        <li class="default">The mother is fed after a few hours --tea or milk, with bread. She
                            is given food in a leaf-plate for the first few days, from far. The <em>dai</em>
                            is the only one who can touch her, until <em>Chhati</em>.</li>
                        <li class="default">The baby is put to the breast after 5 or 6 hours of birth. The <em>
                            dai</em> teaches her how to breastfeed if she doesn&apos;t already know.</li>
                        <li class="default">Meanwhile the <em>dai</em> buries the cord and placenta, in cowdung
                            or in the ground. If the cord is buried deep, the next child will be born after
                            a long gap.</li>
                        <li class="default">If the <em>dai </em>were to give some blood from placenta to a barren
                            woman, that woman will conceive a child, but the first woman will never have another
                            child. </li>
                        <li class="default">The <em>dai </em>applies oil for six days, feeds the woman, gives
                            her <em>ajwain </em>water, foments with arandi leaves, and ties waist with a cloth.</li>
                        <li class="default">The <em>dai</em> gives ghunti ( a nourishing drink) to the child
                            every week. </li>
                        <li class="default">The<em> dai</em> looks after mother and child intensively for about
                            six days. Then, <em>Chhati</em> is performed.</li>
                        <li class="default">If the placenta did not fall out spontaneously, the dai looks after
                            the mother for nine days, not six.</li>
                        <li class="default">A woman should rest for several days after delivery but the exact
                            period she is made to lie down differs depending on her state of health and the
                            requirements of her household.</li>
                        <li class="default">On the third day after delivery, <em>halwa</em> is distributed in
                            the village.</li>
                        <li class="default">The <em>dai </em>goes to her own home soon after the delivery, but
                            comes regularly everyday for the next few days.</li>
                        <li class="default">On <em>Chhati</em>, the mother and child&apos;s bedding is picked
                            up, the <em>dai</em> is given neg (gift/money), and there is samdhi milan. [See

                    <ol type="a">
                        <li class="default">If a child is transverse usually the <em>dai</em> may say the woman
                            should be taken to the doctor. However, one <em>dai</em> said she is able to turn
                            a <em>terha</em> baby to the correct position.</li>
                        <li class="default">If the baby is <em>ulta</em> (breech) the <em>dai </em>turns it
                            around to seedha position. By the fifth or sixth month a <em>dai </em>knows the
                            baby&apos;s position, and is able to turn it by massaging (sontna).</li>
                        <li class="default">If a woman is so weak she cannot push she may be directed to a doctor.
                            However, this does not seem to have happened much. The compounder or nurse may be
                            called in to give injection -- this too does not seem to have happened much.</li>
                        <li class="default">If labour pains do not start, although the baby has moved down,
                            the nurse may be called to give injection. </li>
                        <li class="default">However, typically the <em>dai</em> performs a number of facilitation
                            techniques (described in 1 above), which are supportive of the mother and usually
                            prove sufficient to induce the labour pains.</li>
                        <li class="default">The <em>dai</em> acquaints herself with any specific causes that
                            the woman is &quot;not opening up&quot; -- it may be that it is an illegitimate
                            child; a dai describes that once the woman had eloped against her parent&apos;s
                            wishes, and it was only after the father came to the house and met her, that she
                            was able to deliver her baby.</li>
                        <li class="default">If the mother&apos;s cervix is too small, it is potentially dangerous
                            for both mother and child, the child may die during labour and the mother may become
                            listless. The dai feeds the mother, then rubs her cervix with mustard oil or <em>ghee</em>,
                            massaging until its size increases. This is more likely to happen with a younger
                            woman.</li>
                        <li class="default">A dry labour can be difficult. Putting specific herbs under her
                            pillow helps.</li>
                        <li class="default">During labour, if the head is big the neck may get stuck, the <em>
                            dai</em> pulls it out with her hand.</li>
                        <li class="default">If the baby is not moving around when in the womb, help may be required.
                            However <em>dais</em> report having themselves delivered already-dead babies.</li>
                        <li class="default">If the cord is around the baby&apos;s neck during delivery, a <em>
                            dai</em> will hold it with her hand, a little away from the neck, and gradually
                            loosen it as the head emerges.</li>
                        <li class="default"><em>Dais</em> are confident about delivering twins, and most have
                            done so.</li>
                        <li class="default">A number of dais have handled delivery of a handicapped child.</li>
                        <li class="default">If the baby, once born, is not active, the placenta may be heated
                            as a resuscitation device.</li>
                        <li class="default">If the baby is breathing but not crying, it is put into lukewarm
                            water: it sneezes, then breathes.</li>
                        <li class="default">If a baby is premature, it is well looked after immediately after
                            delivery and over the next few days/weeks. It is wrapped up in cotton or woollen
                            clothes and never exposed to wind. It is massaged several times a day. It is kept
                            near a fire to warm it. The mother takes out breastmilk and gives it to the child
                            in a spoon.</li>
                        <li class="default">If water is coming out of the baby&apos;s nose, the doctor may be
                            called and tetanus injection given.</li>
                        <li class="default">If the placenta delivery is obstructed, the <em>dai</em> may decide,
                            after attempting milder methods, to put in her hand and pull it out. <em>Daisi</em>
                            who have done this report no incidence of broken cord, or haemorrhage.</li>
                        <li class="default"><em>Dais</em> are confident that they can handle extremely complicated
                            and difficult deliveries (&quot;..no child has died in my hands&quot;...).</li>
                        <li class="default">In situations of complication and delay, often a dai may call in
                            one other dai for assistance and support in handling the case.</li>
                        <li class="default">In situations of complication and delay, the dai relies on her own
                            experience, the grace of the <em>devi</em>, and the strength of the <em>prasauti </em>
                            -- Said one, &quot;There is no other way one can see. We have gone to earn, and
                            now, here it is a matter of life and death that we are faced with....&quot;<br />

                        <li class="default">In Gomia, the<em> dais</em> are <em>Harijans</em> and even the <em>
                            Santhali</em> women call them for deliveries.</li>
                        <li class="default">There are a few doctors, ANMs and compounder in Gomia, a Mission
                            Hospital run by the Mahila Jagriti Kendra, and a hospital attached to the Indian
                            Explosives Limited (for its employees). The hospital at Hazaribagh is supposed to
                            be good. </li>
                        <li class="default">According to an MJS worker who has had 5 deliveries in the IEL hospital,
                            she goes to hospital only because her husband, being an employee of IEL, has access
                            to free delivery for her, and this leaves him `free&apos; from responsibility; she
                            herself would prefer home delivery, because i) the hospital bed is very narrow and
                            I can&apos;t push there; ii) the mother is neglected after birth, only the baby
                            is looked after, while at home a <em>dai</em> looks after both mother and baby;
                            iii) in the hospital the doctors and nurses do not wait, like a <em>dai </em>does;
                            iv) in hospital a cut is made (episiotomy); v) injections are given in hospital;
                            vi) the nurses abuse verbally -- neither nurse nor doctor has a humane attitude,
                            treat the women like animals...;vii) the nurse doesn&apos;t come even when called.</li>
                        <li class="default">Another MJS worker reported that during her childbirth in a private
                            nursing home in Gomia, &quot;the nurse tied my hands and feet to bed with my <em>sari
                                pallu</em>, then said, Push!...How could I push?!&quot;</li>
                        <li class="default"><em>Dais</em> noted that they have never faced death due to a complication
                            they could not handle. Rather, they exercise their judgement and, if they see a
                            complication they cannot handle, they advise the family to take her to a doctor.
                            If there has been a delay in this, it is on the part of the family, not on their
                            part.</li>
                        <li class="default"><em>Harijan dais </em>are called in by the Santhalis too. Among
                            the middle and higher castes, the <em>jajmani</em> system prevails whereby each
                            dai has her fixed<em> jajmans</em>, she may have about 10 villages which are `hers'.</li>

                        <li class="default">Midwives in the area are uniformly low-caste (<em>Chamarin or Chamain</em>).</li>
                        <li class="default">They are uniformly poor. Rather than buy the bus tickets for the
                            workshop, for instance, they walked sometimes ten miles. They were (initially and
                            misguidedly) hoping for `jobs&apos; as an outcome for the workshop. </li>
                        <li class="default">They are pursuing this as a caste-based hereditary occupation. It
                            is learned from older women of the family -- sometimes <em>dadi </em>or mother,
                            more often <em>saas</em> or <em>gotni </em>(elder sister-in-law).</li>
                        <li class="default">The occupation is regarded as low-status. Educated young women would
                            rather not be associated with it. In the workshop, a striking example was presented
                            by Saroja Das, a `Sahayogini&apos; (Mahila Samakhya worker), who had been working
                            with the Mahila Jagriti/ Mahila Samakhya set for several years, yet had never before
                            revealed her caste-name (Das), or the fact that her own mother and <em>dadi </em>
                            (paternal grandmother) are <em>dais</em>. [It is at the same time interesting that
                            a woman&apos;s group should not have accessed such basic information about their
                            own member].</li>
                        <li class="default">Although people come from far to call her for a delivery, yet a<em>
                            dai</em> is looked down upon, doesn&apos;t have izzat (honour). As Saroja put it,
                            the work of the <em>dai </em>interests her, but others do not treat that work with
                            respect and therefore she chooses not to do it. </li>
                        <li class="default">Some <em>dais</em> are keen to teach their daughters or daughters-in-law,
                            but lament that the younger women do not want to learn the work.</li>
                        <li class="default"><em>Dais </em>earn very little, and want their children to do better.</li>
                        <li class="default"><em>Dais</em> are feeling some competition from modern medicine
                            and the modern system, and are keen to upgrade their own skills and knowledge. However,
                            they have very few avenues for this in their present situation.</li>
                        <li class="default">Yet <em>dais </em>are respected for their knowledge and skills.
                            As one sahayogini put it -- the dai uses her hands during delivery -- that is good.&quot;
                            Women report feeling safe with and trusting the dai.</li>
                        <li class="default">Since a <em>dai </em>here attends a number of deliveries, as apprentice
                            and helper, before beginning to handle the work independently, she builds up a stock
                            of experience and skills which stands her in good stead over the next many years.</li>
                        <li class="default">People respect the goodness and wisdom of the <em>dai</em>, and
                            know that although she herself is poor, yet she takes no money for deliveries in
                            the home of the very poor.</li>
                        <li class="default">Many <em>dais </em>say they do the work out of sheer necessity.
                            In the beginning, some report feeling fear and repulsion, while others report a
                            growing confidence born of close observation of a number of deliveries.</li>
                        <li class="default">For her own delivery, the neighbouring <em>dai</em> is called, rather
                            than one&apos;s own mother-in-law, due to sharam.</li>
                        <li class="default">The bond with the <em>dai</em> does not end with delivery, rather
                            it continues over the years. Women come to her for a host of other ailments as well.</li>
                        <li class="default">Yet, because she uses her hands for this `dirty work&apos;, the
