    Some of the practice and knowledge of dais can only be understood in terms of a
    world view based on microcosm-macrocosm simultaneity. Pre-modern cultures and Asia
    specific medical traditions recognize a dynamic world where similar patterns exist
    at the microcosmic and macrocosmic levels. Pre-modern systems use underlying organizing
    principles in which these patterns are framed. In the context of dais’ work the
    principles of ‘balance’, ‘life force’ and reciprocity or exchange of energy are
    utilized. Microcosm-macrocosm systems of correlation and causality differ radically
    from Newtonian mechanistic action-reaction ideas of causality.<br />
    <br />
    Post-modern medical therapies, such as psycho-neuroimmunology (PNI), stress management,
    neurolinguistic programming (NLP), foot reflexology and healing visualizations,
    are all gaining recognition as effective holistic treatment modalities. These interdisciplinary
    modalities are also based on recently recognized (by the West) interrelationships
    between the brain, behaviour and the immune system. Indigenous medical therapies
    such as Yoga, Acupuncture, Shiatsu, chakra-based healing, also map the human body
    with principles of correlation and causality foreign to classical biomedicine.<br />
    <br />
    In this way of understanding, which has been called ‘superstition’ and ‘magic,’
    the human body is located in the natural world and the cosmos. Dais and traditionally-oriented
    women open doors, windows, locks and knots during labor in order that the womb may
    open. What is ritually accomplished in the outside world will be mirrored in the
    inside world of the body.
