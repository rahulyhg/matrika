        so many babies but have cut only 12 cords — of my own 12 children. I always make

        “It is my job to cut the cord. However, I do not cut the cord of babies who are
        related to me. They are my own blood. The cords of these babies are like my roots,
        so how can I cut my own root? I handle the births but someone else cuts the cord.”

    The cutting of the umbilical cord and the handling of the placenta is a matter of
    utmost importance to traditionally oriented people. The cord and placenta which
    connected mother and child, are of cosmic significance and represent the mother-child
    bond—this relationship is almost a cultural icon. Even the Goddess is considered
    Ma! Whether considered dirty or sacred, the value placed on these body parts is
    important for us to recognize. (It is also interesting to note that placental blood
    and substances are now being used routinely in the United States for medical and
    genetic research and therapeutic value.) Of primary interest here is their indigenous
    medical use and concerns in managing the birth and the mother postpartum.<br />
    <br />
    The practice of not cutting the cord until the placenta is delivered is common in
    all the areas we have studied. Doctors, health workers and anthropological literature
    report the custom throughout the country. Dais have the utmost respect for these
    parts of the female body usually considered as waste products by the bio-medical
    system or highly polluting by the Brahmanic religious texts. Dais consider the infant-cord-placenta
    as a package. They have been together for nine months with cord and placenta functioning
    to nurture the fetus—why should they be severed too quickly? The placenta is considered
    “another mother” to the baby. Sometimes this afterbirth is buried with rituals and
    prayers for the well being of the infant. It is believed that how the placenta-cord-sac
    is handled influences the child’s health in later life.<br />
    <br />
    It is true that the act of cord cutting is looked down upon as dirtying and degrading
    by many traditionally-oriented people. Sometimes dais, family and neighborhood women
    will manage the birth itself and call in a low or outcaste woman only to cut the
    cord and handle the afterbirth. In fact a lot of young women from dai communities
    are not learning birth work precisely because of these attitudes and their own aspirations
    for modern, higher status jobs. Caste and gender biases intersect when the female
    body, the byproducts of pregnancy and the work of birth are denigrated.
    <br />
    <br />
    But most dais handle these bodily parts and value their function in growing the
    fetus. Dhapo, a dai from Delhi, says that she never cuts the cord and that cutting
    the cord is a great sin. It is as though something alive, having jeevan, life, is
    being violated by being severed. According to Dhapo, the right to perform that act
    belongs only to the mother. Within her body the baby grew; she gave birth; and now
    it is she who has role of finally separating this new life from her body. A Punjabi
    claims she cannot cut the cord of family members because it is like cutting her
    own roots. We even heard of a villager whose right to inherit his family home was
    questioned because he was born in Safdarjung Hospital and thus his placenta was
    not buried in the compound!<br />
    <br />
    Standard medical practice involves the cutting of the cord before the placenta is
    delivered. The biomedical reasoning behind this practice is rather obscure—most
    doctors are not aware of the rationale behind it. Many nurse-midwives and doctors
    in the west are questioning the need for quick cord-cutting. In India dais use the
    placenta as a tool to revive an infant who is not breathing. They stimulate it with
    heat and claim that life flows from the placenta into the child. Although we have
    no physiological understanding of how this practice might work, we must assume that,
    being so widespread it must be effective, at least sometimes. One dai in Rajasthan
    said “In hospitals you have machines and medicines. Here we don’t have those means
    to help a newborn who isn’t breathing—we need to be able to use what means we know.
    So we use the placenta.” Formal Dai training is often not taken seriously by dais
    because it teaches dais to cut the cord before the placenta is out. This is so contrary
    to all that the dais know that it undermines other, more valuable aspects of training.
    Also communities have been known to ostracize dais who have cut the cord prematurely
    and, according to them, this caused subsequent problems.
