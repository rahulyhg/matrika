    <span class="kcpt4">“After the baby is born, the shareer (body, but also womb-birth
        passage) is open. In our place a clean cloth is made into a thick pad, it is warmed
        and placed on the shareer. So that hawa does not come.” (Munni, Delhi)<br />
        <br />
        “After birth of the baby, woman has gola pains. When the baby is in the womb then
        gola maintains and protects it. Gola is along with the baby. After birth gola is
        left alone so it looks for the baby in the womb. And this gives pain to the new
        mother. Therefore we immediately give warm halwa for her to eat and this heats and
        eases the gola. A warm pot is placed on her abdomen for fomentation. This eases
        her pain.” (Manori, Rajasthan)</span><br />

    loosely translated as wind, but more specifically, like Vata in Ayurveda, it means
    movement or motion. Hawa also colloquially refers to the activities of spirit forces,
    usually with negative associations, as in burra hawa, a bad wind. The word gola,
    loosely translated as ball or something round, is used to describe a phenomenon
    or energy perceived to exit the body in form of ‘bad blood’ and clots. Gola is also
    thought of as being related to the energy that has grown and sustained the baby
    in utero.<br />
    <br />
    In all MATRIKA research areas, hawa-gola are considered threats to the woman’s wellbeing
    postpartum. Our current understanding is that hawa-gola, often referred to together,
    are some kind of matter, force or energy which must come out of the body (through
    the vagina or birth canal), and by all means not go up into the upper part of the
    body. This explains the concern about the placenta going “up” in the body, medically
    speaking, a retained placenta. Although dais literally refer to the “placenta going
    up”, they mean that the energy of the body which developed the fetus must not be
    retained within the body. If this hawa-gola energy remains within the maternal body,
    then it is considered a cause for pathology.<br />
    <br />
    Interestingly one of the words dais gave for hawa-gola was ‘mamta’ which means mother’s
    love. This concept displays an active notion of the space the baby has occupied.
    The mother’s physical and emotional experience of connectedness to the baby, within
    her body, is holistically acknowledged, as is the space left postpartum. The gola
    is ‘the baby’s home’. It ‘searches for the baby’ after birth. Interestingly both
    sensation and perception are attributed to the female womb. What in biomedical language
    is termed ‘involution’ of the uterus, is considered a phenomenon experienced by
    the whole body/person. The pain of the contracting uterus is caused by this ‘search’
    for the baby. The space previously occupied by the baby is now empty and must be
    dealt with or it will become a site for the pathology of ‘hawa-gola’.
