<div class="event">CHILDBIRTH FILM FESTIVAL 2008</div>
The First Delhi Childbirth Film Festival was held in May, 2008 was
sponsored by the Delhi Birth Network, Matrika and Kriti Film Club. The
following films were screened: Birth in the Squatting Position (10 mins,
Brazil), Born at Home (60 mins, India), Birth Day (10 mins, Mexico) The
Business of Being Born (83 mins, USA). The Delhi Birth Network is a
group of professionals and concerned citizens in whose purpose is to
raise awareness of and promote safe and supported birth and
evidence-based care, from pregnancy through postpartum. They provide
information and education to women and their families to enhance their
understanding of birth as a normal life process and enable them to make
informed decisions.

<div class="event">Born At Home</div>
Born at Home observes indigenous birth practices and practitioners in
parts of India (rural Rajasthan, Bihar, and the urban working class area
of Jahangirpuri in Delhi). Poised between social reality and the eternal
mystery of childbearing, the film poses a critical question. When dais
or midwives are known to handle about 50% of births in India, why does
the state not recognise the inherited and low-cost skills of the almost
one million traditional practitioners in the country? Natural birth
clinics and home births are increasing in numbers in the west, but our
brand of progress continues to undermine our vast and centuries-old
knowledge base. There are innumerable instances where modernity has only
served to reinforce prejudices. The film presents an intricate
delineation of the figure of the dai who is almost always a low-caste,
poor woman. Unlike medical science to whose life-saving power the best
of dais pay homage, indigenous birth methods are holistic, conceiving of
childbirth not as pathology but continuation of organic life. Gender and
class issues are juxtaposed with images of the postpartum massage, the
ritual bath, and finally the miracle of an actual birth. Mind-body,
earth-cosmos become one unified whole when, negotiating the nether world
of pain and labour, a new life thrusts it way up into the sun. The dai's
hands are experienced and empathetic as she guides the process.


<div class="event">The Business of Being Born</div>
Birth is a miracle, a rite of passage, a natural part of life. But birth
is also big business.
<br />
Compelled to explore the subject after the delivery of her first child,
actress Ricki Lake recruits filmmaker Abby Epstein to question the way
American women have babies. Epstein gains access to several pregnant New
York City women as they weigh their options. Some of these women are or
will become clients of Cara Muhlhahn, a charismatic midwife who, between
birth events, shares both memories and footage of her own birth
experience.
<br />
Footage of women having babies punctuates the film. Each experience is
unique; all are equally beautiful and equally surprising. Giving birth
is clearly the most physically challenging event these women have ever
gone through, but it is also the most emotionally rewarding. Along the
way, Epstein conducts interviews with a number of obstetricians, experts
and advocates about the history, culture and economics of childbirth.
The film's fundamental question: should most births be viewed as a
natural life process, or should every delivery be treated as a potential
medical emergency?
<br />
As Epstein uncovers some surprising answers, her own pregnancy adds a
very personal dimension to THE BUSINESS OF BEING BORN, a must-see movie
for anyone even thinking about having a baby.

<div class="event">National Consultation on the Role of Dais in
National Rural Health Mission - May 2008, New Delhi, India</div>
They reported that Dais (Traditional Birth Attendants) continued to play
an important role both in home and in institutional deliveries in
different parts of the country. And where institutional deliveries were
on the rise, the Dai were involved in providing timely referral,
accompanying mothers to the hospital and staying with her, and providing
post-natal care and advice.

<div class="event">Hammamet Call to Action from Tunisia</div>
In 2006 the 1st International Forum in Hammamet, Tunisia, on "Midwifery
in the Community", organized by the International Confederation of
Midwives, the United Nations Population Fund and the World Health
Organization, put out a Call to Action for the strengthening and scaling
up of midwifery in the community - to contribute to the prevention of
the deaths and disabilities of mothers and their newborns, as well as
promoting the health of mothers and babies.

<div class="event">Campaign to humanize birth in Costa Rica</div>
A press release from 2001, this is a call for improving the quality of
care of women and babies at the time of birth and denouncing the
mistreatment, abuse and humiliation of women and babies in hospital
labour and delivery wards. Sounds very much like the situation in India.
