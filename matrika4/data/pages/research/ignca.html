    <h3>
        Part I &#8212; the context</h3>
    Interest in indigenous knowledge is increasing as the general public, and even policy
    makers observe the onslaught of problems associated with modern life. Traditional
    medicine is explored for use in the treatment of HIV/AIDS; indigenous knowledge
    is utilized in the service of agriculture and biodiversity conservation; strategies
    for the validation and protection of indigenous knowledge systems are being developed.
    It is finally being acknowledged that we have left behind valuable resources along
    this road to progress and &#8216;development&#8217;. This paper explores and reclaims
    indigenous childbirth knowledge, generally, and on the Indian subcontinent specifically.
    First I will briefly (and critically) address the current scenario of how the world
    is being born&#8212;and the problems associated with what has come to be called
    &#8216;the medicalization&#8217; of childbirth.
    <br />
    Within this scenario women give birth very differently according to their class
    status. The mass medicalization of birth effectively constructs this female physiological
    process as a medical, rather than a womanly and human phenomenon. Medicalization
    has negatively impacted poor and well off in different ways&#8212;as well as displacing
    indigenous practitioners, skills and knowledge systems.
    <br />
    <br />
    Data from one Indian study on caesarean rates showed that interventions during labour
    are correlated to families&#8217; utilization of private sector institutions, indicating
    that the ability to pay actually compromises women&#8217;s health, as will be shown
    below, there is no evidence that outcomes are better.<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        There is reason to believe that current rates are part of a rising trend. This cannot
        be attributed only to the rise in institutional deliveries because of the strong
        association between caesarean sections and private sector institutions&#8230;. In
        Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, the risk of
        undergoing caesarean section in private sector institutions is four or more times
        that of a public sector institution.
    </p>
    <br />
    From the heart of the global public health establishment, the World Health Organization,
    comes the observation that improvement in outcomes (the well being of mother and
    newborn) are not associated with high caesarean rates.
    <br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        Continued increases in rates of obstetrical intervention are unlikely to lead to
        improvements in birth outcome and may result in a higher incidence of adverse outcome
        for mothers and their offspring. The risks associated with caesarean section include:
        damage to uterine blood vessels; accidental extension of the uterine incision; damage
        to the urinary bladder; anaesthesia accidents; wound infections; maternal mortality.
        Depressed Apgar score; higher rates of neonatal respiratory distress; shortened
        mean length gestation; and higher perinatal mortality in subsequent pregnancies
        are also indicated. (World Health Organization publication, 1992. <em>International
            Differences in the Use of Obstetrical Interventions</em>)</p>
    <br />
    Interestingly these statistics are not showcased in UN public health agencies&#8217;
    data and publications currently. Perhaps because Safe Motherhood policies are formulated
    by biomedical doctors and the public health establishment who would rather be perceived
    as rescuers of women in distress, rather than practitioners over-utilizing obstetrical
    interventions!
    <br />
    <br />
    However, buried in medical and health policy journals critical evaluations do exist&#8212;such
    as this reference to a caesarean &#8216;epidemic&#8217; in developing countries.
    In &#8220;Over-medicalisation of Maternal Care in Developing Countries&#8221; the
    author concludes, &#8220;the epidemic of C. sections continues in Latin America
    and extends into Asia. In addition there are signs of a worldwide epidemic of other
    interventions. There is an urgent need to build strong strategies to promote evidence-based
    interventions.&#8221;
    <br />
    <br />
    Some health analysts advocate that medical institutions themselves should monitor
    caesarean rates performed by obstetricians practicing in their hospitals.<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        J. Quilligan, MD, an editor of the<em> American Journal of Obstetrics</em> and <em>Gynecology</em>
        wrote, &quot;Every hospital that has an obstetric service should have some committee
        that examines every cesarean section that is performed in that hospital and determines
        whether it was indicated or not. If it was not indicated, then the physician who
        performed the section should be educated as to why it was not indicated.&quot;
    </p>
    <br />
    Often the obstetricians performing surgeries are out of touch with women&#8217;s
    suffering which is caused by surgical interventions.<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        The lack of concern among many obstetricians about the after-effects of the rising
        caesarean rates may result from the fact that they spend little time post-natally
        with women who had had caesarean sections and are far removed from any physical
        or psychological ill-effects resulting from the operation.
    </p>
    <br />
    On the other hand, some research confirms that within a supportive environment,
    the judicious interfacing of traditional practitioners and quality referral units
    in case of emergency, birth at home can be not only affordable, but also relatively
    safe.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Comprehensive Rural Health Project in Jamkhed, Ahmednagar District of Maharashtra
    was the site of a study following 2861 deliveries&#8212;85% of these births were
    at home. Hospitalized patients with obstetric complications constituted only 11.4%
    of all deliveries. The caesarean section rate for all deliveries was only 2.0%.
    This is with poor and rural women&#8212;in urban hospitals it is not uncommon for
    caesarean rates to reach 50%!
    <br />
    <br />
    The authors point out the policy context that their findings radically question
    and make their own recommendations.
    <br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        Some assume that in developing countries hospital service for the poor must be in
        government hospitals and that a large proportion of deliveries needs to be in these
        hospitals to provide timely access to emergency care. This presents a major problem
        in countries like India, where almost all rural deliveries are at home and accessible
        government hospitals generally do not provide surgical treatment for obstetric emergencies.

        A network of private clinics with a voluntary, low cost hospital providing effective
        EmOC in a remote rural area at very low per capita cost in the absence of easily
        accessible government service and with only 15% of deliveries in hospitals. Charges
        are low but low per capita cost is primarily due to intelligent self-selection of
        patients who need hospital care. Even though overall cost is low, cost is still
        an important barrier for many poor families. Improving the purchasing power of poor
        families through insurance or subsidy could be a more effective way to improve EmOC
        than trying to improve inadequate government facilities.per capita cost is primarily

        overall cost is low, cost is still an important barrier for many poor families.
        Improving the purchasing power of poor families through insurance or subsidy could

    <br />
    Although there were maternal deaths, there were only two (70 per 100,000 live births
    whereas the National Family Health Survey estimates the national average as 450
    per 100,000 live births) and these, according to the authors, could have been avoided
    by earlier referral to hospital.
    <br />
    <br />
    Socio-cultural phenomena are also implicated in high Caesarean rates among the moneyed
    classes. The induction of labour, often leading to c-sections if the cervix does
    not open, is sought by mothers-to-be or their families for various reasons: in order
    to bring the mother and baby home by Diwali; to time the birth to be auspicious,
    according to astrological reckoning; and one interesting study asserted that the
    90% rate among middle-class Calcutta women was due to patient-selected surgery as
    a means to avoid postpartum work in the mother&#8217;s sasural!

    <h3>
        Part II&#8212;The Dais and Narak</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        Look, sister, at the time of birth it&#8217;s only the woman&#8217;s shakti. She
        who gives birth, at that time, her one foot is in heaven and the other, in hell
        (narak). The woman&#8217;s shakti is indeed a lot when she gives birth to a child.
        Before doing a delivery I get the woman to open all the trunks, doors and so on.
        I pray to the One above to open the knot quickly. I take off the sari, open the
        hair and take off the bangles or any jewellery. I put atta on a thali and ask the
        woman to divide it into two equal parts. Also I get Rs.1.25 in the name of Sayyid
        kept separately. But mostly I remember Bemata. Repeated I pray to Bemata &#8220;O
        mother! Please open the knot quickly. (Shakina Dai &#8211; A Muslim midwife from
        Delhi)
        <br />
        <br />
        Girls are considered holy before puberty. The marriage of a young girl, who has
        not had her periods, is performed with her sitting on her father&#8217;s lap. After
        puberty the woman is considered unclean, and is unholy, because she bleeds, and
        this is Narak. (Bihar)
        <br />
        <br />
        On Chhati day the Narak period ends. The Dai checks if the umbilical cord has fallen
        off. Then she bathes the baby and beats a thaali (plate). After this the woman is
        bathed and wears new clothes. The Dai cleans the room where the delivery took place
        and the woman was kept separately for six days. The dirty clothes of mother and
        child are washed. After this the Dai is given soap and oil for bathing. All this
        is on the sixth day after delivery. (Bihar)</p>
    <br />
    As a writer-researcher I have studied traditional Indian midwifery&#8212;dais and
    their knowledge of the female body, skills and customs&#8212;for many years. While
    taking the Shatabdi train to Chandigarh some years ago, I met the United States
    Agency for International Development public health professional in charge of &#8220;reproductive
    health and nutrition&#8221;. As we stood in the train chatting he asked if I were
    still active in research on dais. I said &#8216;yes&#8217;. He spoke the standard
    line &#8220;If a birth is normal, then dais are fine, but if any complication arises,
    they are incapable of handling it. I spontaneously responded to his statement, by
    sharing what we were learning about the use of the placenta, stimulating it by heat,
    to resuscitate a listless newborn. The gentleman&#8217;s eyes glazed over and he
    terminated the conversation with a polite &#8220;I hope your research goes well.&#8221;
    I got the impression that I could have quoted any set of health statistics, no matter
    how spurious, and we could have continued talking. But because I, as academics would
    say, &#8216;shifted the terms of the discourse&#8217; and mentioned the lowly placenta,
    and what I had learned from some dais, our communication could not proceed.
    <br />
    <br />
    Safe Motherhood discourse in India speaks the language of statistics&#8212;how many
    mothers die and of what complications. But that interface between the mother&#8217;s
    body and the growing fetus, the placenta, and its indigenous medical use by <em>dais</em>,
    is outside the boundaries of professional public health discourse. Equally unmentionable
    is the vast legacy of indigenous, hands-on and low-tech, body knowledge of dais&#8212;because
    this healing and health modality has been totally rejected as viable knowledge by
    &#8216;modern&#8217; professionals. Yet if we, the powerful, moneyed and English-educated
    segment of the Indian populace (including doctors and public health professionals)
    are serious about reducing maternal and infant mortality and reaching any kind of
    &#8216;health for all by the year&#8230;.&#8217; we must reach out to indigenous
    practitioners like the <em>dais</em> and the traditionally oriented women whom they
    serve, and make efforts to understand their ethno-medical expertise and religio-cultural
    knowledge systems. &#8220;Participation&#8221;, a much bandied about term in NGO
    circles, is meaningless unless such mutually respectful exchanges take place.
    <br />
    <br />
    Too many health policy makers and bio-medical institutions are frozen in their approaches
    to maternal-child health, in part because they presume that western medicine is
    the only scientific and effective body-knowledge system&#8212;and that dais are
    ignorant and superstitious. These presuppositions inform so many well-intentioned
    health care initiatives. An advertisement for a health guide for grassroots women,
    <em>Where Women Have No Doctor</em>, illustrates this perspective:<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        All over the world women rise to their daily work, care for their families and participate
        in community life. Too often, women must face these challenges while struggling
        against illness&#8212;<em>lacking even basic information about their health</em>.
        (Italics, mine)
    </p>
    <br />
    It is truly shocking that people who mean well are so ignorant of the knowledge
    and skill resources of &#8216;the other&#8217;. Thus an indigenous, culturally appropriate,
    affordable and sustainable body of knowledge is rendered invisible in the enterprise
    of &#8220;development&#8221; and delivery of health services.
    <br />
    <br />
    And this invisibility pervades the professional mind-set. Scientific method seems
    to have culminated in a process in which validation of efficacy necessitates double-blind,
    randomised control trials. This methodology may be suitable for pharmaceuticals,
    but not for indigenous, holistic therapeutics which heal or restore balance in the
    body via multi-factoral interventions. The dominance of this research paradigm challenges
    researchers to describe, interpret and value indigenous therapeutic methods. These
    health and body-knowledge modalities utilize Asia-specific body mappings and draw
    upon human capacities alien to bio-medical and public health approaches. Even qualitative
    research methodologies use biomedical assumptions as a starting point, enter the
    field armed with questionnaires and interview schedules, and neglect to contextualize
    their research in the grassroots realities of extreme poverty and radically different
    ontologies and epistemologies
    <br />
    <br />
    Furthermore &#8216;gender&#8217; becomes a whipping boy and health interventions
    fail to apprehend traditionally oriented women as subjects, knowers and decisionmakers
    within their own contexts.<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        Linking modern with traditional understanding and practice can be a despairing task&#8230;.
        At times, we just cannot do it. This may be because we see something wrong--anti-woman--in
        a tradition being followed with devotion by many women. Or, we may feel we do not
        know enough or anything at all about a set of practices and the belief system behind
        them. (Dr. Mohan Deshpande, Curriculum Revision and Development, Women and Health
        Programme)</p>
    <br />
    It is essential that indigenous cultural resources be valued rather than denigrated
    as a stumbling block that detracts from the use of more appropriate biomedical treatment&#8212;especially
    in the case of childbirth, which is not a pathological state.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
        MATRIKA Methodology</h3>
    In 1997 we set out to research <em>dais</em>&#8217; knowledge and practice&#8212;the
    indigenous heritage of women&#8217;s body knowledge encoded in religio-cultural
    forms. The ethnographic data contained in this paper is drawn from three years of
    research by MATRIKA (Motherhood and Traditional Resources, Information, Knowledge
    and Action)&#8212;an NGO effort to document, interpret and analyze traditional midwives&#8217;
    ethno-medical and religio-cultural traditions. The MATRIKA team learned of dais&#8217;
    practices and cosmo-visions in three years of workshops in Rajasthan, Bihar, Punjab
    and slums on the outskirts of Delhi. Invaluable assistance was provided by local
    NGOs, particularly their health workers who were themselves from the communities
    and often had longstanding relationships with the dais. Health workers, who are
    not a part of the professional cadre, or part of the NGO establishment, often have
    a &#8216;feel&#8217; for the language and orientation of traditionally oriented
    women. When given permission from their superiors they can be an invaluable human
    resource in orienting organizations toward a respectful understanding of the &#8216;client&#8217;
    communities. Unfortunately, being keenly aware of the power and attitudes of their
    supervisors, they usually remain quiet.<br />
    <p class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
        MATRIKA&#8217;s methodology has been to reverse the common TBA (Traditional Birth
        Attendant) training model by asking groups of <em>dais</em> to &#8216;train us&#8217;
        by answering the question &#8216;what does a woman need during pregnancy, labour,
        birth and postpartum?&#8217; Role plays, ritual drawings, singing of birth songs,
        sharing of birth experiences (ours and theirs) as well as <em>dais</em>&#8217; life
        narratives were our workshop activities. We were able to access, and remain with,
        this alien (to us) information because we decided at the outset not to execute the
        common approach of limiting ourselves to the modern categories of &#8216;medicine&#8217;
        and &#8216;health&#8217;. Rather we chose to be receptive to diverse ways of facilitating
        birth, diagnosing and healing&#8212;to ritual enactments, notions of deities and
        demons, <em>bhut-pret </em>(ghosts and spirits) and the <em>nazar</em> or evil eye.
    </p>
    <br />
    We attempted to let the data speak the categories rather than have the categories
    shape the data. At first, of course, dais seemed to want to impress us with their
    knowledge of the modern, biomedical approach. But especially after our own enactments
    of the loneliness and confusion of a woman labouring in a hospital, they were convinced
    of our critical evaluation of modern birth and began to trust and share what they
    really believed and practiced. Ours was a collective effort: a group of researcher-activists
    interacting with a group of dais. We ate, slept, talked, sang and danced, produced
    drawings and plays together. Our workshop activities were a celebration of the fertile
    capacity of female body and of the dais&#8217; cultural handling of childbirth.
    Our goal was to generate data which would enable informed, interactive dialogues
    between indigenous and biomedical practitioners.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
        Rethinking &#8220;pollution&#8221; and reformulation of narak</h3>
    Mediation between the ethnomedical and the biomedical, and retrieving valuable cultural
    resources, involves crossing boundaries and listening carefully&#8212;to the unspoken
    as well as spoken words. We learned that although the <em>dais</em> use some of
    the language of caste Hindu (and Sikh, Muslim and Christian) orthodoxy, denoting
    the defiling nature of birth, older<em> dais</em> often maintain a healthy distance
    and ironic <em>disdain</em> for the attitudes which demean their work. Inheritors
    of the <em>dai</em> tradition see themselves primarily as servants of the life force
    and can&#8217;t be bothered with rebutting Brahmanic theological and caste formulations&#8212;they
    are occupied with delivering babies, caring for their families and agricultural
    and other work.
    <br />
    <br />
    Although often translated as hell or demonic place, <em>narak</em> can be understood
    as the site or energy of the unseen inner world&#8212;of the earth and of the body.
    <em>Narak</em> has the connotation &#8216;filth&#8217; but also signifies the fertility
    or fruitful potential of the earth and woman&#8217;s body. So-called &#8216;pollution
    taboos&#8217; are related to <em>narak</em>, in that the idea of the sacred is radically
    separated from the reproductive potential of the female body. During menstruation
    and post partum women are considered &#8216;unclean&#8217;. However the dai speaks
    with a very different voice than the pundit about <em>narak</em>. To her the placenta,
    the ultimate polluting substance to caste Hindus or the &#8216;twice born&#8221;,
    is spoken of reverently, as &#8216;another mother&#8217;. It is no coincidence that
    dais are mainly from and outcaste communities. Both caste and gender are involved
    in concepts of narak. (Ayurvedic and naturopathic practitioners often employ low
    caste people to apply the hands-on therapies they prescribe). And interestingly
    in our MATRIKA team&#8217;s analysis of birth time (which in obstetrical terminology
    is referred to as &#8216;labour&#8217;, &#8216;birth&#8217; and &#8216;postpartum&#8217;)
    we adopted some of the dais&#8217; language of &#8216;the opening body&#8217;, &#8216;the
    open body&#8217;, and &#8216;the closing body&#8217;. <em>Narak</em> thus can be
    viewed as representing &#8216;the open body&#8217;. This is the time when what is
    normally closed (literally the cervix) is open, and that is the liminal and dangerous
    time/space of generative, female bodily processes.
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Narak</em> also functions as a basic ethno-medical idea, providing a conceptual
    framework for a host of non-invasive therapeutic interventions.<em> Narak</em> signifies
    the inner world of the body, particularly the mysterious creative power of the female
    body (and simultaneously the earth body) invisible to the human eye. This concept
    allows for a mode of understanding facilitating non-invasive diagnostics and therapeutics.
    Dais practice gentle techniques to negotiate and affect the inner body without violating
    the integrity of the skin/body/life force. And indeed the dais&#8217; holistic health
    modalities utilize touch (massage, pressure, manipulation), natural resources (mud,
    bath and fomentation, herbs), application of &#8216;hot and cold&#8217; (in food
    and drink, fomentation etc.) and behavioural changes (isolation and protection from
    domestic, maternal and sexual obligations).<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        After delivery a woman is not given any grain or heavy food. This is called narak
        fasting (narak upwaas or fasting during the time of narak). Grain is only given
        on the third day after all the dirty blood comes out. On first day, she eats biscuits
        with tea. She drinks warm water. Second day, heat- producing balls made out of ginger,
        pepper, turmeric, roasted rice, milk and jaggery (saunth laddos). Third day, rice,
        lentil soup and vegetables. Rice is not given immediately after birth. First, we
        massage her. This relaxes her muscles, only after this she can digest her food.
        Turmeric lessens pain, dries the shareer (body, generally, and vagina/womb, specifically)
        and the saunth helps in forming milk (Pairia Devi, Bihar)
        <br />
        <br />
        It is called dirty blood because it has collected over nine months in the body.
        It is dark, smelly and clotted. It comes out first and then fresh clean blood comes
        out. With a little pressure and massage we take it out completely, and when the
        color of the blood becomes clear like monthly cycle we believe that it is clean.
        (Swarn Kaur, Punjab)
        <br />
        <br />
        Gola is baby's home. When the house becomes empty, only dirty blood is left. When
        this comes out there is pain. Hot brew (ajwain, saunth, pipar and gur) is given.
        This drink cleans the belly. After the baby is born, the gola roams around. This
        gola has taken care of the baby, now it must leave. If the pain is intense then
        warm fomentation is done and gola melts away (pighal jata hai). This is dirty blood
        and needs cleaning up. (Kamala, Delhi)
        <br />
        <br />
        On the 13th day after birth, the new mother is allowed to enter the kitchen. (Chauka
        Charhana). Some do it on 7th or on 11th day. Everybody celebrates. There is singing
        and dancing. On this day the new mother and the baby bathe and wear new clothes.
        She comes out to get everyone's blessing. Friends and relatives are invited and
        eat food together. The Dai is given clothes, food and grain. (Punjab)
        <br />
        <br />
        On the day of the birth ritual celebration (Chhatti-6th day) the women wears everything
        that was taken off at the time of the birth. She put on <em>bindi</em>, bangles,
        henna and nose ring. We make ritual drawings of<em> Swasthik</em>, put ritual drawing
        here worship <em>Bemata</em> and light a lamp. We make a foot impression of the
        mother on the floor and then the woman enters the main house. Till the 5th day <em>Bemata</em>
        roams around in the house. After the birth celebrations <em>Bemata</em> leaves,
        she goes to another house. The <em>dai</em> also goes to serve others. (Paana, Rajasthan)

        Conclusion</h3>
    <em>Narak</em>, as the unseen source of life and site of birth and death, provides
    a field for indigenous cultural reasoning to play. But this play is not simply fantasies
    of the imagination. It is an empirically grounded mapping of female physiological
    processes. And this mapping allows for the sophisticated indigenous reasoning system
    of diagnostics and therapeutics, as shown above. <em>Narak</em> provides space for
    intuition, imagination, other epistemologies and other therapies. Female embodiment
    is known and respected. Dignity is bestowed on human qualities: the need for affectionate
    touch; processing and expressing emotion; the reality of physical sensation. Conceptual
    categorization does not dominate and attempt to control female physiological processes.
    <em>Narak</em> and <em>Bemata</em> can hold both ethno-medical knowledge and the
    mysteries inherent in the birth process.

    The challenge to biomedical practitioners and public health professionals, as well
    as policymakers at all levels is the creation of a vital interface, a placenta&#8212;if
    you will, between themselves and the women who bear and deliver the majority of
    the babies born in India. We must learn to speak the languages of placenta and <em>narak</em>.
