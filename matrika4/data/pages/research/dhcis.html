        Menstruation Meanings: Blood, Time and Magic
    </h2>
    <span class="caption">This paper was written at the request of the Dharam Hinduja Center
        for Indic Studies by Janet Chawla</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    At a Dharam Hinduja Center for Indic Studies organized gathering in Bangalore some
    years ago I met an old colleague and friend, an NGO activist working in the Northeast
    of India with women and women&#8217;s health. We conversed outside of the formal
    sessions about my work on indigenous &#8216;reproductive health&#8217; (specifically
    menstruation and childbirth) and her activist and training work. She told me that
    at a recent training program conducted for her NGO by an activist-physician from
    Uttar Pradesh, he had stated that the practice of allowing menstrual blood to flow
    down one&#8217;s legs, under their skirt-like wraps (which was observed by some
    of the traditionally oriented tribal women) was unhygienic and a possible source
    of infection and should be stopped. She asked me what I thought of the practice
    and the physician&#8217;s intervention.
    <br />
    <br />
    I responded by saying that although we, with our sense of personal hygiene and decorum,
    might find this manner of handling menstruation distasteful, it probably would be
    far less likely to cause infection than an unclean menstrual cloth and I felt his
    advice reflected his own discomfort with the thought of menstrual blood flowing
    freely down female legs rather than any actual knowledge of vectors of infection.
    <br />
    <br />
    At an NGO health workers meeting in Gujarat, I was an observer to an interaction
    between the local dais/health workers and the head of the health program as well
    as an outside resource person--a doctor and health activist of long standing. The
    meeting was called in order to monitor the progress of an effort to build the skills
    of the dais to help women chart their menstrual cycles--and enable them to practice
    &#8216;natural family planning&#8217;. Becoming aware of the time of ovulation would
    help them practice birth control without invasive methods--was the idea. The non-literate
    dais had been provided calendar-charts to fill in with signs, one for each woman&#8217;s
    menstrual cycle.
    <br />
    <br />
    However, much to my amazement, they used the solar, rather than the lunar calendar
    format. There was total confusion (which may have existed anyway) but the whole
    process would have been more effective had a lunar calendar been used for reckoning,
    as it is closer to the 28 day menstrual cycle, and the ritual festivals observed
    in the area follow lunar, rather than solar months. When I enquired as to how the
    NGO leaders decided to use the solar calendar, they said that they left the decision
    to the dais and village women and they voted to use the solar--the one that they
    knew the NGO followed!
    <br />
    <br />
    More recently I attended a national women&#8217;s health meeting in Delhi. During
    one presentation made by a women&#8217;s health NGO on their work with adolescents,
    the speaker said that they had taught young women to hang their menstrual cloths
    out to dry in the sun after washing them. She self-righteously stated that one mother
    even beat her daughter for putting her cloth outside (in view of others). The subtext
    of the presentation being &#8220;These backwards and violent mothers&#8212;we must
    save poor adolescents from them! During the discussion period I raised my hand and
    voiced my concern that NGOs should not intervene in personal bodily practices in
    a manner which would lead a mother to react so vehemently to her daughter&#8217;s
    behavior and I questioned whether the activists had investigated the mother&#8217;s
    reasoning and cultural assumptions. I received no answer but afterwards, in private,
    other participants expressed their appreciation of my speaking out.
    <br />
    <br />
    At issue here is the dominance of modernist biomedicine in the policies and programs
    of health policymakers (be they global--WHO, Unicef, UNFPA etc, national and even
    local feminist and NGO groups. Their &#8216;delivery of services&#8217; and &#8216;training&#8217;
    approaches to health generally, and women&#8217;s &#8216;reproductive health&#8217;,
    specifically, operate in complete ignorance of the epistemological and ontological
    foundations of indigenous body culture and health traditions. In South Asia one
    might even say &#8216;civilizational&#8217; body knowledge and practice.
    <br />
    <br />
    I have paid attention to indigenous Indian understandings, imaging and practical
    handling of menstruation and birth and the visions of the world and cosmos upon
    which they are based for many years. While studying theology with the Jesuits at
    <em>Vidyajyoti</em> Institute of Religious Studies in Delhi, I wrote a paper, &#8220;The
    Mythic Origins of the Menstrual Taboo in the Rig Veda,&#8221; (later published both
    in <em>Manushi</em> and in <em>Economic and Political Weekly</em>, Vol. XXIX, No
    43, 22 October 1994) The paper used feminist protests against the use of Depo-Provera
    and other injections and implants of hormonal contraceptives as a starting point&#8212;because
    these drugs interfere drastically with the rhythm and nature of a woman&#8217;s
    menstrual cycle. I investigated the narrative of Indra slaying Vritra as an explanatory
    mechanism for indigenous meanings and directives regarding menstrual blood and menstrual
    time. And I have continued to pursue these topics intellectually as well as practically
    with NGOs and what I call health and development wallahs.
    <br />
    <br />
    Menstrual bleeding, although often signified in terms of &#8216;pollution&#8217;,
    &#8216;traditionally&#8217; marked the cyclicity of nature (Sanskrit <em>rta</em>)
    and is simultaneous with seasonality and fertility. The fertile capacity of women
    is conflated with that of the earth (and of the Devi, although that is not my concern
    here) and in women&#8217;s ritual enactments this cyclicity is often honored and
    I would argue even sacralized. Priestly notions of pollution fade into the background
    when one listens to the dais and their notions of &#8216;<em>narak</em>&#8217; &#8211;
    which I will develop below -- and the &#8216;sin&#8217; of cutting the umbilical
    cord. In a MATRIKA produced documentary film &#8220;Born at Home&#8221; the filmmaker
    interviews an elderly Rajasthani dai, Rukma Dadi, who laughs as she relates that
    some say it is a &#8216;great paap&#8217; to cut the cord. She confidently dismisses
    society-at-large in their categories of sin and pollution and purity (so ardently
    amplified in early Indological writings). This confidence was shared by the elderly
    dais with whom we interacted during our MATRIKA project. Dai work is &#8216;<em>seva
        ka kam</em>&#8217; or, as one Punjabi <em>dai</em> stated &#8220;<em>Raab</em>
    (God) is the doer, the hands are mine.&#8221; We attempted, through this field level
    research to document and conceptually interpret their imaging of body and world.
    <br />
    <br />
    My purpose here, however, is not to untangle Indological misrepresentations and
    modernist &#8216;maldevelopment&#8217;, but rather to relate some of my own intellectual
    journey as wife, mother, bahu and now grandmother within a Sikh family in Delhi;
    teaching childbirth preparation classes to a middle and upper class clientele; studying
    theology with the Jesuits focusing on Leviticus, the Dharamshatra, Rig Veda, caste
    and gender and birth traditions; and, my favorite, interacting with dais on their
    lives and understandings of the female body. I have moved through Indian, US, British
    and South Asian academic, public health, feminist and activist circles. This game
    of musical chairs is sometimes called networking.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
        MATRIKA Research</h3>
    MATRIKA, (Motherhood and Traditional Resources, Information, Knowledge and Action),
    which I initiated, was a three year research effort to document, interpret and analyze
    traditional midwives&#8217; ethno-medical and religio-cultural traditions. The MATRIKA
    team learned from dais in workshops held collaboratively with NGOs in Bikaner District
    of Rajasthan; Gomia, Bihar; Fategarh District in Punjab and the resettlement colonies
    of Delhi. We inverted the common dai-training model and asked them to train us.
    After they became convinced of our sincerity we collectively explored their knowledge
    and practice through discussions and interviews, role plays of birth and rituals,
    as well as ritual drawings, body mappings and sohars or birth songs.
    <br />
    <br />
    Our reclamation effort, however, required putting aside the assumption, often shared
    by both researcher and religious elite, that spiritual power entails ritual purity.
    The midwife has not been seen in the Indian context as a ritual specialist and a
    resource for sacred knowledge, or in anyway related to &#8220;spiritual&#8221; activity,
    because of their caste status and the fact that female bodily processes were deemed
    antithetical to spiritual power and practice. Probing, not to mention theorizing
    the &#8216;subaltern&#8217; is not an easy task. Modern institutions and academic
    disciplines since colonial times have marginalized dais, in part, because they have
    not been able to comprehend them. As poor, illiterate and mostly low and outcaste
    women, their health knowledge and practice has been denigrated and invisiblised.
    Our MATRIKA approach allowed the categories of religion and medicine to intertwine&#8212;and
    we adapted our research methodologies to grapple with these indigenous, holistic
    childbirth and healing modalities. We also resisted the dominant modern perspective
    that labels dais&#8217; ways of knowing and practices as ignorance and &#8216;superstition&#8217;.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
        Narak and the &#8216;Dirty&#8217; Female Body</h3>
    For many years I have been puzzled by the seeming contradictions I have encountered
    when researching traditionally oriented women&#8217;s birth knowledge and practice.
    On the one hand they use expressions such as nau mahena ka narak kund (nine months&#8217;
    hell spring or pond) for the afterbirth (placenta, cord and membranes) and observe
    what we call &#8216;pollution taboos&#8217; (not doing puja, going to the mandir
    or reading holy books) during menstruation or postpartum. In the Indian context
    it is important to note that women of all the dominant religions on the subcontinent
    have observed ritual pollution. Muslim, Sikh, Christian and Buddhist women have
    practiced their own forms of pollution which involve ritual distance from religious
    practice. (Of course similar ritual separation between women&#8217;s reproductive
    capacity, considered ritual &#8216;impurity&#8217;, and religious practice is also
    to be found in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition. The Book of Leviticus, in
    the Old Testament is strikingly similar to the Dharamshastra injunctions which regulate
    the behavior of women during menstruation and postpartum.)
    <br />
    <br />
    On the other hand the same women report empowering birth rituals both during labor
    and the post-birth period. Differing perspectives on the significance of narak reveal
    the gendered power relations which have existed on the Indian subcontinent for millennia.
    <br />
    I have come to the conclusion that when women and men participate in common rituals,
    as in all of the dominant religions, the special female experiences of the body,
    become inserted in a male-centered, often abstract, conceptual or &#8216;mystical&#8217;
    ritual or praxis domain&#8212;leaving behind uniquely female bodily experiences
    and the religio-cultural customs which celebrate it. The internal logic of dais&#8217;
    ethno-medical and religio-cultural practice proceeds from ways of perceiving and
    knowing which can be legitimately termed religious or even &#8216;theological&#8217;.
    They follow a chain of reasoning and use causal linkages embedded in divine and
    demonic figures. Furthermore dais&#8217; epistomology and ontology are entirely
    congruent with other indigenous systems such as Tantra, Yoga and Ayurveda. A gender-sensitive
    perspective requires questioning why sophisticated and holistic body-spirit knowledge
    and practice are acknowledged within these systems-- but when it comes to knowledge
    and &#8216;spirituality&#8217; related to the female body, dais are perceived as
    ignorant and superstitious. Narak, a concept from our MATRIKA data which I have
    developed and amplified, functions as an entry point and fundamental organizing
    principle for the world view of dais.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
        &#8216;<em>Narak</em>&#8217; as the Unseen and Fertile Inner World of the Earth
        and of the Female Body</h3>
    <em>Bemata </em>dwells in the realm of <em>narak</em>, deep within the earth. She
    is a Creatrix causing the conception, growth within the womb, and birth of human
    beings as well as the growth of all vegetation. During our first workshop in Gomia,
    Bihar dais explained the meaning of <em>narak</em> to us in terms of menstruation
    and postpartum:
    <br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        Girls are considered holy before puberty. The marriage of a young girl who has not
        had her periods is performed with her sitting on her father&#8217;s lap. After puberty
        the woman is considered unclean, and is unholy, because she bleeds, and this is
        narak.
        <br />
        <br />
        On Chhati day (after birth) the narak time ends. The Dai checks if the umbilical
        cord has fallen off. Then she bathes the baby and beats a thaali and gives the baby
        to Chachi. Then the woman is bathed and wears new clothes. The Dai then cleans the
        room where the birth took place and the mother was kept separately for six days.
    </p>
    <br />
    Although often translated as hell or demonic place, narak can be understood as the
    site or energy of the unseen inner world - of the earth and of the body. Narak has
    the connotation &#8216;filth&#8217; but also signifies the fertility or fruitful
    potential of the earth and woman&#8217;s body. Pollution &#8216;taboos&#8217; are
    related to narak, as the idea of the sacred is radically separated from the reproductive
    potential of the female body. During menstruation and post birth women are considered
    &#8216;unclean&#8217;. However the dai speaks with a very different voice than the
    pundit and the Puranas about narak. To her the placenta, the ultimate polluting
    substance to the &#8220;twice born&#8221;, is spoken of reverently, as &#8216;another
    mother&#8217;. It is no coincidence that dais are mainly from low and outcaste communities.
    Both caste and gender are implicated in concepts of narak. Ayurvedic and naturopathic
    practitioners often employ low caste people to apply the hands-on therapies they
    prescribe. And interestingly in our MATRIKA team&#8217;s analysis of birth time
    (which in obstetrical terminology is referred to as &#8216;labor&#8217;, &#8216;birth&#8217;
    and &#8216;postpartum&#8217;) we adopted the dais&#8217; language of &#8216;the
    opening body&#8217;, &#8216;the open body&#8217;, and &#8216;the closing body&#8217;.
    Narak can be viewed as representing &#8216;the open body&#8217;. This is the time
    when what is normally closed, is open, the liminal and dangerous time/space of generative,
    female bodily processes. Interestingly, within the dais&#8217; rubric the danger
    that they are concerned about is to the mother--her openness implying her vulnerability.
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Narak</em> functions as a basic ethno-medical idea, providing a conceptual framework
    for a host of non-invasive therapeutic interventions. Narak speaks of the inner
    world of the body, particularly to the mysterious creative power of the female body
    (and simultaneously the earth body) invisible to the human eye. This concept provides
    a mode of understanding which facilitates non-invasive diagnostics and therapeutics.
    Dais practice many gentle, non-invasive techniques which affect physiological functioning
    without violating the integrity of the skin/body/life force. Their &#8216;holistic&#8217;
    health modalities utilize touch (massage, pressure, manipulation); natural resources
    (mud, baths and fomentation, herbs); application of &#8216;hot and cold&#8217; (in
    food and drink, fomentation etc.); and isolation and protection (from domestic,
    maternal and sexual obligations).
    <br />
    <br />
    In my networking in North India, as well as our MATRIKA research areas, I have found
    that &#8216;traditionally&#8217; <em>dais</em> serve and move between the homes
    of different religious communities--and so do concepts such as <em>narak</em>. Caste
    operates as a category, but religion doesn&#8217;t. It seems as if dais and women&#8217;s
    birth traditions have flown beneath the radar screens of the dominant religious
    orthodoxies that haven&#8217;t bothered to police this dirty women&#8217;s business.
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Shakina</em> Dai, a Muslim midwife, mentions offerings to <em>Sayyid</em>, an
    Islamic figure, but similarly invokes Bemata. She also refers to the laboring woman
    as having one foot in heaven and the other in <em>narak</em> or hell.<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        Look, sister, at the time of birth it&#8217;s only the woman&#8217;s <em>Shakti</em>.
        She who gives birth, at that time, her one foot is in heaven and the other, in hell.
        Before doing a delivery I get the woman to open all the trunks, doors and so on.
        I pray to the One Above to open the knot quickly. I take off the sari, open the
        hair and take off the bangles or any jewelry. I put<em> atta</em> on a <em>thali</em>
        and ask the woman to divide it into two equal parts. Also I get Rs.1.25 in the name
        of <em>Sayyid</em> kept separately. But mostly I remember Bemata. Repeatedly I pray
        to <em>Bemata</em> &#8220;Oh mother! please open the knot quickly.&#8221;
    </p>
    <br />
    <em>Dais</em> from all religions have invoked Bemata. In workshops in the Punjab,
    Mazbi (outcaste) <em>Sikh dais</em>, after first claiming they had no rituals, said
    that they, too, pray to <em>Bemata</em>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
        Networking Knowledge - Advocating for Indic Systems of Medicine</h3>
    I have been enabled to follow my own woman-centered curiosity and move through varied
    domains and disciplines, beholden to no institution or way of thinking, in good
    part by networking. Particularly valuable to me personally, and society at large
    (especially as caesarean section rates skyrocket and the female body is increasingly
    perceived as incapable of menstruation, birth and menopause without pharmaceutical
    or surgical assistance) is the nexus between midwives, who actually handle the female
    body and the stuff of birth, and scholars or academia.
    <br />
    <br />
    As I write this essay at my mother&#8217;s home in Port Townsend, Washington, I
    have just traveled to Vancouver, BC to show our MATRIKA film &#8216;Born at Home&#8217;
    to a group of &#8216;guerilla&#8217; midwives--this has been organized by a midwife-scholar,
    Nane Jordan, whom I had never met. Nane learned of my work in a Women&#8217;s Spirituality
    Masters Program in San Francisco! Through email and mutual friends we came together
    to watch a film on dais--whom the health establishment refuses to dignify with the
    term &#8220;midwives&#8221;--they are Traditional Birth Attendants or &#8216;TBAs&#8217;--to
    be trained, not the inheritors of India&#8217;s midwifery traditions. And the women
    who eagerly watched the film are &#8216;guerilla midwives&#8217; for much the same
    reason. Since the regulation of midwifery under the British Columbia College of
    Midwives in 1998, any woman who &#8216;attends&#8217; a woman&#8217;s birth is doing
    so illegally--and they also are not allowed to call themselves midwives! &#8220;This
    is freedom? This is gender equality? This is women&#8217;s empowerment?&#8221; I
    ask myself as I learn that Nane&#8217;s chosen midwife, who attended her previous
    home birth and is known and respected in their Vancouver birth community, was jailed
    for 5 months for attending births and leading a birth workshop.
    <br />
    <br />
    This issue of regulation, legitimization is not new to me. When I was a scholar-in-residence
    at the Five College Women&#8217;s Studies Research Center, in Western Massachusetts
    I heard an American nurse-midwife speak of a bill that they had introduced to the
    state legislature which would take the certification for midwives out of the hands
    of the Nursing Board and creating a Midwifery Board. My sensitivity to the outsider
    status of dais in India alerted me to the fact that some group of midwives would
    be negatively affected by this move. When I asked the midwife about who would be
    further marginalized by the proposed legislation, she immediately said that it would
    be three categories of women attending births: Native Americans (who have their
    own traditions regarding birth); street midwives (who catch the babies of drug addicts,
    commercial sex workers and homeless women) and Amish women (who have a spiritual
    practice within which birth is not defined within a state, professional or technological
    frame). Each of the above group would be further marginalized, denied any possibility
    of medical backup and even liable to prosecution for helping women birth.
    <br />
    <br />
    The intention of midwifery, as the word&#8217;s origin implies, is &#8216;with women&#8217;
    and not hierarchically or externally placed. These Canadian &#8220;guerilla midwives&#8221;
    are not a homogenous group, nor are they silly and irresponsible women, as the media
    and the medical profession might have us believe. One young recent graduate of nursing
    school was chatting with me after the film and said that she had just turned down
    a job offer at the hospital where she had studied. She found the hospital procedures
    so degrading for herself, as midwife and the mother and family and she would not
    have been allowed to practice her &#8216;calling&#8217; and vision of what a midwife
    could be.
    <br />
    <br />
    Last summer I presented a power point presentation on <em>Narak</em> at a conference
    &#8220;Pollution and Safety: the Dirty Side of Women&#8217;s Health&#8221; organized
    by a dynamic scholar midwife who heads the Department of Nursing and Midwifery at
    Sheffield University. I was suggested as a presenter by another scholar- midwife
    whom I&#8217;d met at an International Confederation of Midwives conference in Delhi
    10 years ago. At the time of the conference I was editing a book on birth commissioned
    by an Indian publisher and editor of their &#8220;Shakti&#8221; imprint and I was
    searching for a paper attempting to place an economic value on dais&#8217; health
    work contribution. <em>Birth and Birthgivers</em>: the<em> Power behind the Shame</em>,
    which is now in press, is an assembly of pieces on birth from varied positions and
    perspectives. It now includes an essay by Subhadra Rai, another conference presenter,
    which she had presented in Japan, &#8220;Towards Calculating the Monetary Contributions
    of Dais&#8217; Work.&#8221;
    <br />
    <br />
    Without these networks which have shown interest in my work and the young women
    interns, volunteers, researchers, MATRIKA team members, who are terribly excited
    by non-biomedical understandings of femaleness--I would not have the confidence
    to continue to theorize, flesh out and advocate for what I have learned from dais.
    <br />
    <br />
    This essay has presented to me clearly that what I do is indeed called networking.
    It is not the usual business-sense or even academic-sense of networking where one
    moves among colleagues to exchange information within a certain domain. In a way
    I network amongst networks--health and religion, anthropology and art, scholar and
    activist, feminist and NGO.
    <br />
    <br />
    It seems to me the task at hand involves a more active role for academicians and
    scholars in interfacing with public health problems such as safe motherhood. For
    too long scholars have been preoccupied with the local; they have not produced coherent
    and simple descriptions of the broad sweep of Indian or subcontinental body knowledge
    and culture. In order to effectively advocate for inclusion of indigenous practitioners
    such as dais, data is needed on commonalities across regions. Certainly herbs may
    be different in different areas--but concepts underlying their efficacy (&#8216;heating&#8217;
    or stimulating metabolic action during labor) will be similar. Dais practices will
    certainly be couched in different regional languages--literally and metaphorically--but
    traditionally, from Punjab to Kanya Kumari, no dai would cut the umbilical cord
    before the placenta emerged. And all dais would stimulate the placenta by heating
    it--in order for the &#8220;jee&#8221; or life force to pass into the newborn, should
    he/she require resuscitation.
    <br />
    <br />
    In India national health policy has been, and continues to be significantly determined
    by &#8216;globalization&#8217;. First, by colonial hegemonic valorization of western
    medicine and science. Now, by World Health Organization, Unicef and the like. Under
    this influence the stated Government of India policy of institutionalization for
    all births is absolute folly and continues to deskill the midwives (and other women
    who attend by far the majority of births) and create dependency on nonexistent or
    abysmal quality services. Today even Ayurvedic Colleges teach more allopathy than
    Ayurveda! And government programs in the Department of Health and Family Welfare
    devoted to ISM or Indigenous Systems of Medicine focus on the promotion of growth
    of herbal medicine, rather than the development of the human resources who &#8216;traditionally&#8217;
    practice this kind of medicine. Surely the project of Indic Traditions of Healthcare
    remains unfinished.
