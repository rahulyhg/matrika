            A crucial subtext can be read in feminist agitations against the injectable contraceptive
            Depo-Provera: The female body is not to be problematised as a site of pathology
            and victimized for its potential fertility. Menstruation is a normal, natural female
            physiological function. In this context it is appropriate to reflect upon traditional
            cultural constructions of the female body and the meanings of menstruation within
            Indian symbolic systems-meanings which have undoubtedly shaped Indian women&#8217;s
            (and men&#8217;s) experiences of female bodily processes.

            Menstruation is the monthly bleeding of non-pregnant women of childbearing age.
            This article explores aspects of uniquely Indian cultural meanings of menstruation
            and constructions of women&#8217;s body. I will first contextualise these meanings
            and constructions in relation to the contemporary discussion of the feminist agitation
            against the injectable hormonal contraceptive Depo-Provera.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            Feminist groups have been agitating against the Drug Controller of India&#8217;s
            attempts to allow the introduction of Depo-Provera in the Indian marketplace. Opposition
            to Depo (and other hormonal contractives, Net-en and Norplant) has been articulated
            by critics utilizing various discourses. Women&#8217;s group have used medical research
            and language to expose the many negative side-effects of injectable and implantable
            contraceptive technology and emphasized the dangers of its use with poor and rural
            women where health is already compromised. Human rights and feminist organisations
            as well as the socially concerned medical community have used the issue of resource
            distribution to question those &#8216;development wallahs&#8217; and bilateral funding
            agencies who advocate a &#8216;quick technological fix&#8217; approach to family
            planning and population control. Critics of the New Economic Policy point out that
            in the name of liberalization, free trade, and &#8216;development&#8217; foreign
            multinationals and their Indian collaborators (such as Upjohn and Max Pharma &#8211;
            the purveyors of Depo) will have laissez-faire access to the Indian consumer without
            the monitoring and protection of coherent national drug policy.

        <p align="left" class="default">
            This is, of course, a gross oversimplification of a complex debate. Nevertheless,
            there is a significant omission from this discussion. The most frequently encountered
            consequence of Depo-Provera (of its active ingredient DMPA &#8211; a synthetic form
            of the female hormone progesterone) is alteration in the menstrual cycle. &#8220;Some
            women will experience unpredictable or prolonged bleeding or spotting&#8230;most
            users develop amenorrhea (suppression of menstruation) after several months of use&#8221;
            <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>(emphasis mine).</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            In this current age of ecological awareness, many people are beginning to recognize
            that the cycles and processes of nature (seasons, the atmosphere, river waters,
            the earth) must be respected and sensitively handled. Ironically it seems as though
            this sensitivity does not extend to the natural physiological cyclicity of women&#8217;s
            bodies: menstruation. One group of women&#8217;s health activists have accurately
            described the situation. &#8220;In the case of hormones used for oral, injectable
            and implantable contraception, never before have so many women been given potent
            medicine continuously to suppress a condition (fertility) that is not a disease&#8221;<sup><a
                href="#2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            I would suggest that a crucial subtext can be read in feminist agitations against
            Depo-Provera: the female body is not to be problematised as the site of pathology
            and victimized for its potential fertility. Menstruation is a normal, natural female
            physiological function.</p>

            Within this context it is appropriate to reflect upon traditional cultural constructions
            of the female body and the meanings of menstruation within Indian symbolic systems
            &#8211; meanings which undoubtedly have shaped Indian women&#8217;s (and men&#8217;s)
            experiences of female bodily processes.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            Obviously traditional Indian cultural constructions of menstruation differ considerably
            from the bio-medical model. In many parts of south India a girl&#8217;s first menstruation
            was until recently celebrated publicly: after emerging from seclusion the young
            woman was bathed, dressed in bridal finery, and garlanded with flowers. Aesthetic
            renderings of a young woman kicking an Ashoka tree imply that it is her shakti which
            cause the tree to bloom. In tantric rituals, which probably have their origins in
            tribal and folk cultures, menstrual blood was one of the offerings made to the goddess.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            According to historian N.N.Bhattacharyya, different areas of India have had notions
            of the menstruating goddess. In Punjab it was believed that Mother Earth (&#8216;Dharti
            Ma&#8217;) &#8216;slept&#8217; for a week each month. In some parts of the Deccan
            after the &#8216;navaratra&#8217; goddess temples were closed from the tenth to
            the full moon day while she rests and refreshes herself. In Malabar region, Mother
            Earth was believed to rest during the hot weather until she got the first shower
            of rain <sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>. Still today in the Kamakhya temple of Assam
            and in parts of Orissa the rituals of the menstruation of the goddess are celebrated
            during the monsoon season. Both the fertile earth and woman must rest be venerated
            and celebrated.
        </p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            Bhattarcharyya notes that the auspiciousness of menstruation, representing potential
            fertility, is symbolized by blood or the colour of blood and is regarded as sacred.
            Sindur applied in the part of the married woman&#8217;s hair symbolizes the sacredness
            of her fertile potential (when exercised within the confines of patriarchal marriage!)
            Deities and sacred objects are daubed with red colouring as a part of ritual worship.
            Within Indian culture, red signifies auspiciousness and potential growth &#8211;
            these ancient religious ideas and symbols are definitely linked to the blood of
            menstruation.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            Understanding these nuances of India&#8217;s cultural history it is surprising to
            find that some studies have shown that Indian women experience menstrual irregularity,
            spotting, or lack of menstruation as significant problems <sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup>.
            Sociologist Veena Das explains the cultural assumptions which underline this experience.
            &#8220;&#8230;.the female body makes the notion of regularity of nature available
            to mankind. For the Hindus, it is the regular periodicity of menstruation that is
            the guarantee of the regularity of nature. Thus, the word &#8216;rtu&#8217; stands
            for both seasons and the menstrual cycle. Similarly the word for the woman&#8217;s
            menstrual cycle and the moon&#8217;s cycle is the same, showing that the rhythms
            of the body and the rhythms of the cosmos are in harmony&#8221;<sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup>.
            However, the Hindu traditions themselves are also deeply ambivalent in their constructions
            of menstruation as the following investigation of the menstrual taboo reveals.</p>

            Commentary on the Rig Veda has occupied human minds for literally millennia. Very
            few of those minds happened to be women&#8217;s. I began my study of the Rig Vedic
            text in order to understand the mythic origins of the ritual taboos associated with
            menstruation. In this article I will present the woman-centred concerns which I
            bring to the RigVeda, a feminist interpretation of the textual material and speculations
            about the historical meaning of the mythic and symbolic elements of the narrative.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            Having worked as a childbirth educator and advocate of &#8216;natural childbirth&#8217;
            among voluntary organizations I became increasingly frustrated with the medical
            model of pregnancy and birth. Surely, I reasoned, there must be traditional, indigenous
            and empowering knowledge about women&#8217;s bodies. I decided to document traditional
            Indian childbirth practices which seemed to me to be more congruent with my natural
            childbirth orientation. I worked with the Ankur-Action India women&#8217;s health
            group in Delhi to collect stories of women from all classes and religious backgrounds
            about their experiences with menstruation, pregnancy, birth and mothering.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            From these interviews emerged two conceptual areas which appeared significant. One
            was ritual pollution. Almost every woman spoke of her body as being considered unclean
            or impure during the time of menstruation and post-partum. Women told of being prohibited
            from going to the Mandir, Masjid or Gurdwara performing or participating in Pujas,
            not reading books as well as the importance of bathing rituals after menstruation.
            One basti woman described the blood of childbirth as &#8216;rook hua&#8217; (stagnant)
            and the placenta as &#8216;nau mahena ka narak kund&#8217; (nine months&#8217; hell
            vessel).</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            Second was the well worship ritual<sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup>. Many of the &#8216;basti&#8217;
            women mentioned a ritual worship of the well (or in the resettlement colonies the
            nal, or water tap) on &#8216;chhatti&#8217; after childbirth. As they described
            the ritual it was actually worshipping the water source rather than a purification
            ritual.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            Thus I encountered two seemingly contradictory ritual and belief systems. In Brahmanical
            Hinduism woman&#8217;s body and procreative capacity is defined as a source of ritual
            impurity. Water or bathing is understood to be purifying; washing away bodily pollution.
            On the other hand the worship of water source, a woman-centred ritual involving
            singing and celebration, constructs both the well and water as sacred. Symbolically
            the well is analogous to the yoni. Wells in many parts of India are constructed
            in a yonic shape. Just as baby emerges from the watery womb &#8211; the source of
            life &#8211; so the well, in the traditional Indian setting, was the source of water,
            necessary for the continuing life of people, plants, animals. Interestingly some
            slum women in resettlement colonies around Delhi reported the community water tap
            (in the absence of the village well) as the focus of ritual celebration post-partum.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            I asked myself rather simple questions: why are menstruation and the blood of childbirth
            considered ritually polluting? What are the origins of a belief which is so categorizes
            women&#8217;s body and the miraculous biological processes which bring new human
            life into the world? (I should acknowledge that defining women&#8217;s bodily processes
            as polluting and antithetical to religious practice is not unique to Hinduism. It
            is also a part of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition.) I got my first inkling
            of an answer when I discovered the myth of Indra slaying Vritra.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            Myths are traditional stories which serve to unfold part of the world-view of a
            people and or explain a practice, belief or natural phenomena. Myth serves various
            functions in any given society. First, a metaphysical function; myth orients a person
            vis-&#224;-vis the world, the cosmos, and society and imbues experience with meaning,
            often understood as religious or spiritual. Second, myth serves a social function
            of providing role models, prescribed or tabooed actions and dramatically revealing
            consequences of behaviour. Third, myth provides a pedagogical tool; as the young
            hear the stories of their elders, they learn about themselves and the world and
            begin to understand their environment and the behaviour expected from them in ways
            acceptable to their family and group <sup><a href="#6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            In Rig Veda, Indra&#8217;s slaying of Vritra (or the Vritras) is referred to over
            100 times. Most Vedic scholars agree that this killing is the central dramatic event
            in India&#8217;s oldest existing text.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            In the Rig Veda, Vritra is depicted as the withholder of the waters, the demon of
            droughts, a snake or dragon-like figure who dwells in the rivers or celestial waters,
            or in a cavern in the earth. He lives in the caves with the cows. Indra kills Vritra
            with his thunderbolt, thus releasing the waters, the cows, and wealth, prosperity,
            and progeny.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            Keith notes that Vritra is the primary enemy of the Vedic gods: &#8220;He is a serpent
            with power over the lightning, mist, hail and thunder when he wars with Indra, his
            mother is Danu, apparently the stream or the waters of heaven, but he bears that
            name himself as well a Danava, offspring of Danu.&#8221; According to Keith, Vritra
            paradoxically resides within the waters, but also on lofty heights which suggests
            the waters of the air. His name denotes&#8221;&#8230; the encompasser of the waters,
            rather than the holder back by congealing them: the cloud mountain is therefore
            said to be in his belly&#8221;. Indra, the Vritra slayer, is also the breaker of
            forts. Keith notes that Vritra &#8220;has 99 forts which Indra shatters as he slays
            him&#8221;<sup><a href="#7">[7]</a></sup>. It is this frequently used epithet of
            Indra as &#8220;fort-breaker&#8221; which has led some scholars to speculate that
            the aboriginal peoples (the Vritras, Asuras, Dassas or demons of the Rig Vedic text)
            were the occupants of the Harrapan cities such as Mohenjodaro.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            I will attempt to understand the figure of Vritra in two ways. First, by reading
            the text as an historical document reflecting the Aryan encounter with, and the
            subordination of pre-Aryan indigenous peoples; simultaneously seizing and exploiting
            natural resources and appropriating pre-existing cultural forms. How did the deification
            of Indra and the demonisation of Vritra construct an ideology which legitimized
            the Indo-European domination over the native peoples? What can be inferred from
            the narrative and symbolic content of the text about the social organization, values,
            and cultural forms of the original inhabitants of the subcontinent? Second, I will
            use as a working hypothesis the idea that the figure of Vritra is inextricably linked
            with a pre-existing matristic social system and a world-view which valued the sacred
            (or powerful) feminine.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            Existing critical literature recognizes the marginality of women in the Rig Veda.
            J. Gonda acknowledges that &#8220;Women are a rare subject: they are mainly mentioned
            in metaphors and, as a collectivum, in similes&#8221;<sup><a href="#8">[8]</a></sup>.
            Wendy Doniger O&#8217;Flaherty categorically states &#8216;The Rig Veda is a book
            by men about male concerns in a world dominated by men; one of these concerns is
            women, who appear throughout the hymns as objects, though seldom as subjects&#8221;<sup><a
                href="#9">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            The text, however, speaks for itself on the general category of women: &#8220;Indra
            himself hath said, the mind of woman brooks not discipline, Her intellect hath little
            weight&#8221;) RV VIII 33.17). (Ironically this aphorism is put in the mouth of
            a heroic warrior known for neither his intellect nor his self-discipline.) &#8220;With
            women there can be no lasting friendship: hearts of hyenas are the hearts of women&#8221;)
            RV X 95.15).</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            Indologists have interpreted natural symbolism in the Rig Veda within various conceptual
            frameworks. However the task of decoding what Gonda refers to as &#8216;similes
            and metaphors&#8217; as real human persons, not just part of the natural flora and
            fauna, has not, to my knowledge, been attempted. Androcentric scholarship, both
            Indian and western, has been quite happy to leave unchallenged categories of man
            = culture whereas woman = nature&#8217; (and primal peoples = nature whereas dominant
            people = constructed culture). I suggest that the cows, rivers, and caves can be
            read as referents to both the mythic feminine and to real historical women and groups
            of women. (More precisely, &#8216;proto-historical&#8217; because there is considerable
            evidence that our hypothesized matristic society was in fact, the pre-Vedic, Harappan
            civilization. The Harappans had a form of writing which has not yet been deciphered,
            and is thus technically &#8216;proto-historical&#8217;.)</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            Interestingly Vritra, in fact all the demons of the Rig Veda, are known by matronymics
            rather than patronymics. Vritra is a Danava, son of Danu. In one passage, describing
            his death, the Rig Veda links the two in imagery of cow and calf: &#8220;The vital
            energy of Vritra&#8217;s mother ebbed away, for Indra had hurled his deadly weapon
            at her. Above was the mother, below was the son; Danu lay down like a cow with her
            calf&#8221; (RV 1.32.9, translation O&#8217;Flaherty).</p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            <span class="default">My hypothesis is that Vritra is mythically and symbolically linked
                to pre-patriarchal, pre-Vedic social formations. By re-interpreting the slaying
                of the &#8216;son of the mother&#8217;, we discover the mythic origin of the later
                brahmanic pollution ideology which devalues and de-sacralises the female bodily
                processes of menstruation and childbirth while simultaneously glorifying the patriarchally
                constructed institution of &#8216;motherhood&#8217;.</span></p>
        <p align="left" class="default">
            The Dharmashastras, the lawgivers&#8217; treatises on how to live a proper life,
            contain various proscriptions on that a menstruating woman should and should do
            and should not do. In this text, Chapter 5 of the Vasishtha Dharmashastra, menstrual
            taboos and woman&#8217;s subordinate social position are related to the narrative
            of Indra slaying Vritra.</p>

        (7) For, it has been declared in the Veda, &#8220;When Indra had slain Vritra, the
        three headed son of Tvashtri, he was seized by sin, and he considered himself to
        be tainted with exceedingly great guilt. All beings cried out against him saying
        to him &#8220;O thou slayer of a learned Brahmana!&#8221; He ran to the women for
        protection and said to them, &#8220;Take upon yourself the third part of this my
        guilt caused by the murder of a learned Brahmana. &#8220;They said, &#8220;Let us
        obtain offspring if our husbands approach us during the proper season, at pleasure
        let us dwell with our husbands until our children are born.&#8221; He answered,
        &#8220;So be it&#8221;. Then they took upon themselves the third part of his guilt.
        That guilt of brahmana-murder appears every month as the menstrual flow. Therefore
        let him not eat the food of a woman in her courses for such a one has put on the

        In this text we find practices relating to the seclusion and restrictions of menstruating
        women explicitly linked to the mythic drama of Indra&#8217;s slaying of Vritra.
        This myth is found first in the Rig Veda and subsequently woven through various
        texts &#8211; in this paper we shall only consider the Rig Veda, but the Satapatha
        Brahmana and the Taittireya Samahita of the Black Yajur Veda also are germane to
        an understanding of how female physiology is constructed, symbolically and narratively
        linked to the mythic slaying of Vritra and incorporated into Vedic sacrificial liturgy
        and ritual.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Mircea Eliade, writing of the Vritra myth, notes the Indian practice of astrologically
        determining the placement of a peg into the earth before building a structure. The
        peg is to secure the head of the snake (thought to reside in the earth) and prevent
        it from shaking and destroying the building. &#8220;But the act of foundation at
        the same time repeats the cosmogonic act for to &#8220;secure&#8221; the snake&#8217;s
        head, to drive the peg into it is to imitate the primordial gesture of Soma (RV
        2.12.1) or of Indra when the latter &#8220;smote the Serpent in his laid&#8221;
        (6.17.9) when his thunderbolt &#8220;cut off its head&#8221; (1.52.10).&#8221; According
        to Eliade&#8217;s interpretation the serpent Vritra symbolizes chaos, the formless
        and non-manifested. He supports this understanding by textual references to Vritra
        as &#8220;undivided (aparvan), unawakened (abudhyam), sleeping (abudhyamanam), out-stretched
        (asayanam).&#8221; Eliade proceeds to state that Indra&#8217;s &#8220;hurling of
        the lightning and the decapitation are equivalent to the act of Creation, with passage
        from the non-manifested to the manifested, from the formless to the formed<sup><a
            href="#10">[10]</a></sup>.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Eliade&#8217;s notion of primal chaos is outdated and androcentric. The new physics
        is radically changing scientists&#8217; conceptions of order and chaos. Phenomena
        previously understood as chaotic now seem to display an underlying sense of order.
        It is masculine &#8216;creation&#8217; which involves hurling of lightning (read
        sperm) and decapitation is a rather anomalous symbol for creativity. What has previously
        been understood as &#8216;primal chaos&#8217; might now reveal itself as a matristic
        social and symbolic order. The creative order of the menstrual cycle and the rhythms
        of labour may involve stress and pain &#8211; but not the violence to the &#8216;other&#8217;
        depicted in the Indra-Vritra slaying. The essential question remains &#8220;what/whom
        is really being killed?&#8221;</p>
    <p class="default">
        Eliade reasons that because Vritra had confiscated the waters and was keeping them
        in the hollows of the mountains that either &#8220;Vritra was the absolute master
        &#8211; in the same manner as Tiamat or any serpent divinity &#8211; of all chaos
        before the Creation; or that the great serpent, keeping the waters for himself alone,
        had left the whole world ravaged by drought.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="default">
        But Sjoo and Mor interepret the pervasive Indo-European serpent and dragon metaphor
        in a radically different fashion. They state unequivocally that &#8220;the serpent
        of chaos is originally and always a woman&#8217;s body. As the Great Mother of Chaos,
        of matter still unformed and undifferentiated, she holds the earth like an egg in
        the pure energy of her coils.&#8221; Sjoo and Mor understand the &#8220;Great Mother
        of Chaos&#8221; to represent the &#8216;time before the gods&#8217;, which preceded
        the establishment of patriarchal hierarchies and distinctions. Within this woman-centered
        interpretation, &#8220;the dragon of matter, the Undivided One older than the individuation
        of forms&#8221;, also signified the flesh and blood bonds which unified the people.
        These authors link the snake/dragon with &#8220;the indigenous &#8216;masters of
        the ground&#8217; &#8211; the matrifocal peasantry &#8211; who are invaded, conquered,
        plundered, co-opted by the &#8216;dragon-slayers&#8217; of patriarchal history&#8230;.&#8221;
        In Sjoo and Mor&#8217;s analysis Indra&#8217;s murder of Vritra initiates the creation,
        not of the cosmos, but of patriarchy. &#8220;&#8230;In the Indo-European view the
        dark, serpentine Danu and Vritra had &#8216;withheld the waters in the mountain
        hollows&#8217; and so hindered the world from coming into being. The Indo-European
        patriarchal world, that is&#8221;<sup><a href="#11">[11]</a></sup>.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The violence of the Vritra murder is recapitulated in the ritual metaphor of the
        serpent needing to be pegged for masculine &#8216;construction&#8217; to take place.
        (That this metaphor is still operative in the folk mind is obvious from the worship
        of the Nag which took place in many Garhwali villages after the Uttarkashi earthquake.)
        We are claiming that another paradigm of order, not primal chaos, can be discerned
        in the text; one that is congruent with women&#8217;s procreative capacity, menstrual
        and lunar cycles and the hypothesized matrifocal social order. I am suggesting that
        what preceded Vedic ideology on the sub-continent was not the primal chaos of chthonic
        peoples, but a previously unrecognized, humanly constructed social order. The death
        and dismemberment of Vritra can be viewed as a metaphor for the Indo-European exercise
        of power, symbolic and martial, over the pre-existing peoples and their culture.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The mythic Indra was, after all, a warrior par excellence: the Rig Veda is a martial
        document. Scholars have debated whether the warfare was literal, ritual, symbolic
        &#8211; between groups of men, men and demons, gods and demons, etc. But Vedic study,
        both Indian and foreign, has neglected a crucial question which Uma Chakravarty
        poses: &#8220;Whatever Happened to the Vedic Dassi?&#8221; Chakravarty, in her deconstruction
        of &#8220;the myth of the golden age of Indian womanhood as located in the Vedic
        period&#8221;, emphasizes the historiorgraphic foregrounding of &#8220;the Aryan
        woman (the progenitor of the upper caste woman) as the only object of historial
        concern&#8221;. Chakravarty notes &#8220;It is no wonder then that the Vedic dasi
        (woman in servitude), captured and subjugated, and enslaved by the conquering Aryans,
        but who also represents one aspect of Indian womanhood, disappeared without leaving
        any trace of herself in 19th century history&#8221;<sup><a href="#12">[12]</a></sup>.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The Indo-Europeans infiltrated the sub-continent in different waves, c 1500-1200
        BC. The Aryan hymn singers of the Rig Veda lionized the exploits of Indra &#8211;
        his swigging of Soma, his rape of Ushas, his plundering of booty for his followers
        and also his killing of Vritra. Sukumari Bhattacharji calls Indra a culture hero
        <sup><a href="#13">[13]</a></sup>.</p>
    <p class="default">
        As Chakravarty&#8217;s historiographic essay implies, a focus on the dasi and the
        figure of Vritra implicitly questions the legitimacy and sanctity of this heroic
        paradigm. Warfare has always been a different experience for men and for women.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Gerda Lerner describes the historical process of the enslavement of women in west
        Asia and a similar situation probably existed in ancient India as well, &#8220;Biological
        and cultural factors predisposed men to enslave women before they had learned how
        to enslave men&#8221;. Lerner suggests that physical terror and coercion, which
        were essential ingredients in the process of turning free persons into slaves, took,
        for women, the form of rape. &#8220;Women were subdued physically by rape: once
        impregnated, they might become psychologically attached to their masters&#8230;
        Free sexual access to slaves marks them off from all other persons as much as their
        juridical classification as property&#8230;&#8221; Lerner concludes that there exists
        &#8220;overwhelming historical evidence for the preponderance of the practice of
        killing or mutilating male prisoners and for the large-scale enslavement and rape
        of the female prisoners&#8221;<sup><a href="#14">[14]</a></sup>.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Lerner&#8217;s view is entirely congruent with historians&#8217; views of Rig Vedic
        times. R.S.Sharma describes Vedic life. &#8220;Spoils of war and cattle formed the
        main forms of property. Cattle, horses, and women slaves were generally given as
        gifts&#8221; <sup><a href="#15">[15]</a></sup>. I am suggesting that the Rig Veda,
        however, tentative an historical source, can be read as a mythic version of a lived
        past. Indra&#8217;s slaying of Vritra, like his rape of Ushas, can be understood,
        not just as a phantasmagorical metaphor, but also as the mythic rendering of real
        human experience; of the encounter between the Indo-European patriarchal infiltrators
        and the extant social formation.</p>
    <p class="default">
        D. D. Kosambi interprets Indra&#8217;s rape of Ushas, the goddess of dawn and renewal,
        &#8220;an otherwise inexplicable event&#8221; in terms of a conflict of belief and
        ritual systems. &#8220;The only possible explanation lies in a clash of cults, that
        of the old mother-goddess being crushed on the river Beas by the new war-god of
        the patriarchal invaders, Indra.&#8221; Kosambi explains the survival of the independent
        feminine represented by Ushas in terms of her redefinition; she assumes, within
        an androcentric pantheon, the more familiar patrilineal roles of women &#8211; mother,
        wife and daughter. &#8220;That she survives after being &#8216;killed&#8217; can
        only indicate progressive comparatively peaceful, assimilation of her surviving
        pre-Aryan worshippers, who still regarded her as mother of the sun, wife of the
        sun, daughter of heaven&#8221; <sup><a href="#16">[16]</a></sup>. That the metaphor
        of rape is used, within the text, to assert the domination of god over goddess implies
        that the practice of actual rape was utilized as a method of pacification of human
        women as well. Bloodshed, rape and plunder are all masked in the Rig Veda as the
        heroism of the solar god, pushing back the frontiers of darkness and primal, chaotic
        disorder.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Evidence of a Rig Vedic overlay on a pre-existing meaning system is provided by
        Dipak Bhattacharya in his chapter on the birth of Agni. In a section interestingly
        titled &#8220;The flow of rta from the obscured mothers of Agni&#8221;. Bhattacharya
        grapples with the imagery of &#8216;rta&#8217; (cosmic order) and &#8216;rajas&#8217;
        (menstruation). Agni is said to have been born in the depth of the great and &#8216;in
        the yoni of this rajas&#8217; and is referred to as &#8216;the embryo of the waters&#8217;.
        The aqueous origin of Agni in the atmospheric region is a well-recognized Vedic
        idea. Bhattacharya writes of the symbolic meaning of &#8216;the waters&#8217;. &#8220;It
        has to be noted that in a different context Pischel and Geldner recognize that the
        waters are imagined as females with their regular (sic) peculiarities, mainly periods.
        The high waters of the rains are regarded as catamenia (menstruation) and their
        drying up as menopause. In the context of the birth of Agni the rains may symbolize
        not catamenia, but locial (childbirth) discharge&#8221;<sup><a href="#17">[17]</a></sup>.</p>
    <p class="default">
        This symbolic nexus of the waters, rajas (also meaning atmospheric vapour) and rta
        or cosmic order indicate an original mythic structure which sacralises menstrual
        and lunar rhythms and recognizes these rhythms, embodied by women, as principles
        of clarity and order, as well as the source of life.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Perhaps to the indigenous peoples, woman&#8217;s blood was awesome and numinous.
        Women bled monthly, in cyclical harmony with the moon, and yet did not die &#8211;
        rather miraculously produced new life. The blood shed by them, during menstruation
        and childbirth may have been considered sacred emblems of cosmic order. Indra&#8217;s
        slaying of Vritra ended that symbolic connection. As Dharamshastras elucidate, menstrual
        blood comes to be considered loathsome &#8211; powerful, dangerous and threatening.
        Indra expropriates women&#8217;s function of bloodletting. The warrior is socially
        sanctioned to shed his enemy&#8217;s blood &#8211; that act is constructed as being
        heroic, dharmic and sacred, as exemplified in Krishna&#8217;s advice to Arjuna in
        the Bhagavad Gita.</p>
    <p class="default">
        We have foregrounded the symbolic connection between the idea of rta or cosmic order
        and menstrual rhythms. Other scholars, Bhattacharya more recently, and the older
        Vedic Sanskritists Pischer and Geldner have also noted this symbolic connection.
        Further validating this line of understanding rta is the scientifically documented
        phenomenon of menstrual synchrony.</p>
    <p class="default">
        In 1971 the American researcher, Martha McClintock documented the phenomena of human
        intra-group menstrual synchrony <sup><a href="#18">[18]</a></sup>. She observed
        that the menstrual cycles of frequently interacting women tend to become synchronized
        over time, and that this synchronization is related to the extent and frequency
        of contacts between individual women. Anthropological work on the Yurok Indians
        of northern California and aboriginal Australians point towards the &#8216;precontact&#8217;
        existence of menstrual synchrony among the women of these groups, as well as describing
        ritual forms celebrating menstruation and female bonds. The work of McClintock and
        these anthropologists has tremendous relevance to woman-centered attempts to understand
        early human culture.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Returning to the mythic Vritra-slaying two questions remain in this interpretation.
        One, why in the Rig Veda is Vritra grouped with the dasas, and in the later texts,
        including the Dharmashastras quoted above, his slaying is referred to as a brahminicide,
        which would lead us to see him as a Brahmin? Second, why is Vritra usually rendered
        in the neuter, rather than masculine, gender? It seems to me that although the Rig
        Veda is the earlier document actually the later texts contain more information about
        the aboriginal peoples. In the later Vedas, puranas and epics Vritra is further
        personified, fleshed out, and conceptualized. The process of assimilation and absorption
        of pre-Indo European material allowed for what we might call &#8216;prakritisation&#8217;
        i.e. the transformation of the Aryan world-view, which we find more starkly presented
        in the Rig Veda. Brahmins, as a priestly caste, did not yet exist in Rig Vedic times.
        &#8216;The notion of Brahminicide describing Indra&#8217;s slaying of Vritra is
        thus an anachronism. Perhaps the Brahmins, while formulating these later texts were
        appropriating some of the power and legitimacy of Vritra (or proto-brahminic forms)
        to themselves. This is a reasonable assumption because Vritra is textually identified
        as having special powers and may have functioned among the autochthonous peoples
        as a shaman. Nevertheless the device of the &#8216;braminicide&#8217; shows that
        the later Brahmin priests in some way identified themselves with the Vritra figure.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The Rig Vedic Vritra is a demon, dasa, and magician or priest. He exercises the
        power of &#8216;maya&#8217; or illusion. The use of the neuter gender in referring
        to Vritra and the Vritras can be related to the literal meaning of &#8216;vritra&#8217;
        which is concealing-covering-hiding and defending-resisting-protecting. (The root
        vr conveys the idea of aiding or succoring in a positive sense, sheltering <sup><a
            href="#18">[18]</a></sup>. Most interpreters have favoured a natural phenomen
        understanding as mentioned above. This level of meaning is certainly present but
        not exclusive of a socio-symbolic as well biological-symbolic (women&#8217;s biology)
        reading. The neuter gender may have been used because the reference is finally to
        the indigenous people&#8217;s system, a social and symbolic formation. Within the
        Vedic text this system is represented in the form of protective resistance and concealment
        &#8211; masking the beliefs and practices, ruses and maneuvers of a defensive aboriginal
        population.</p>

        In this section I will present other textual evidence which supports this woman-centred
        reading of the Rig Veda. First I will further substantiate the argument that the
        similes and metaphors of cows, waters, maids, mothers. In fact are signifiers for
        the generative capacity of women and that this imagery can be read historically
        as referring to the Aryan assimilation of women from a pre-existing matrifocal social
        order. Then I will consider two different, but not mutually exclusive, meanings
        of rta: rta as the cosmic order of menstrual and lunar rhythms, and a Marxist understanding
        of rta as denoting a pre-Vedic, egalitarian food distribution mechanism. I shall
        then present grammatical and symbolic material relating to the notion of &#8216;mothers-in-common&#8217;
        which further documents the existence of a matrifocal familial pattern. Within this
        context I will examine the symbolic significance of the few references to blood
        in the Rig Veda.</p>

        In RV 6.47.2.2-4 the &#8216;sweet juice&#8217; of Soma &#8220;boldened Indra when
        he slaughtered Vritra.... He who hath created the breadth of earth, the lofty heights
        of heaven, He formed the nectar in the three headlong rivers.&#8221; This cosmogonic
        act of Indra/Soma involves the slaying of Vritra and depositing the nectar (read
        sperm) into the headlong rivers (read genealogies of women). Wilson comments &#8220;Thus
        Soma has deposited the ambrosia in its three principal receptacles&#8221;. This
        mythic death and creation, of course, operate on many levels. Traditional scholarship
        has emphasized the cosmological symbolic (Indra as solar god): the world of nature
        (Indra as vegetation god): and the ritual context of the Vedic sacrifice (hymns
        with liturgical function). But social and biological strata of meaning also are
        evident.</p>

        assembly.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="default">
        The &#8216;child of the three mothers&#8217; is Agni. We have already put forward
        Dipak Bhattacharya&#8217;s thesis of rta and the obscured mothers of Agni. Griffith
        supposes &#8220;the Ladies of the Waters&#8221; to be the Ila. Sarasvati and Bharati<sup><a
            href="#20">[20]</a></sup>. In a socio-physiological interpretation the &#8216;cows&#8217;

        (women) &#8211; &#8216;Mothers&#8217; cluster signifies in both social and symbolic
        realms. Clans or genealogies of women which were &#8216;wandering separate&#8217;
        that is not attached to any male or matrilineally constituted, become assimilated
        into the Indo-European&#8217; patriarchy<sup><a href="#21">[21]</a></sup>. They
        are thus honoured as &#8216;supreme in our assembly&#8217; as Aryan pregenitrices.
        And the salutation &#8216;Streams!&#8217; (indeed the omnipresent metaphor of women
        as water) is thus honouring the facts of female physiology &#8211; bodily fluids
        which indicate generative capacity as producers of progeny: menstrual, vaginal and
        amniotic fluids.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Part of the interpretive problem is that not only were previous commentators andocentric,
        they also shared the patriarchy&#8217;s discomfort with frank discussion of women&#8217;s
        bodies and sexuality. The facts of female biology stream out of the text. From the
        pundit Sayana to the Victorian Indologists, commentators were more comfortable with
        interpretations involving heavenly bodies than female ones. It has taken the Freudians
        to legitimize a discussion of sexuality, but this discussion is still phallocentric
        and individualistic (not exploring the textual evidence for an alternative social
        formation).</p>
    <p class="default">
        The present interpretation foregrounds women as persons capable of full participation
        in the formulation of societal and symbolic systems and female physiology as a locus
        of power. (When we speak of female physiology we do so in a gynocentric sense of
        the total range of female bodily process; menstruation, female capacity for sexual
        pleasure, as well as potential for pregnancy, childbirth and lactation.) Such a
        holistic, woman centred &#8211; and biologically accurate &#8211; definition of
        female physiology implicitly questions the patriarchal assumption of woman&#8217;s
        value as &#8216;the mother of sons&#8217;.</p>
    <p class="default">
        We are positing that female physiology (inclusive of the later desacralised aspect
        of menstruation) may have been a powerful and positive symbolic referent in the
        meaning systems of indigenous peoples. Emblematic of the generative natural world
        and cosmic rhythms, woman&#8217;s physiology may have functioned as a pre-patriarchal
        gynocentric ordering principle which was both symbolic and matrifocal. This involves
        recognizing both the processes of menstruation (as a sign of the independent, cosmically
        syncronised rta) and the biological primacy of the mother (human beings are not
        a sexually dimorphic species &#8211; the central human drama of creating new human
        life happens in the female body not in the male body).</p>
    <p class="default">
        The Rig Vedic hymns reified the female body and provided the symbolic structure
        which sacralised patriarchal. Aryan motherhood (Aditi) while demonizing the independent
        female energy (&#8216;diti&#8217;, &#8216;danu&#8217;, the demon of defloration,
        &#8216;druh&#8217;) and begins the process, developed in the later texts, of assigning
        negative valence to menstruation as death fluid.</p>

        The hymn encourages the sisters to listen or accommodate the bard: receiving the

        &#8216;like a nursing mother&#8217; and &#8216;a maiden to her lover&#8217; further
        validates this reading and reminds us of Lerner&#8217;s suggestion that the motivation

        COSMIC RTA AND YOUNG MAIDS</p>
    <p class="default">
        In the text we find amble evidence to support Dipak Bhattacharyya&#8217;s interpretation
        of &#8220;the flow of Rta from the obscured mothers&#8221; as a veiled reference
        to menstruation. RV 4.19.2-7 reads:</p>
    <p class="default">
        Thou slewest Ahi who besieged the waters, and duggest out their all-supporting channels.
        The insatiate one, extended, hard to waken, who slumbered in perpetual sleep, O

        thou rentest with thy thunder&#8230;.</p>

        They ran to thee (Indra) as mothers to their offspring: the clouds, like chariots,

        He (Indra) let the young Maids skilled in Law, unwedded, like fountains, bubbling,
        flow forth streaming onward.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Indra slays the Ahi/Vritra/Dragon figure who is &#8220;Stretched out against the
        seven prone rivers&#8221;. The rivers-women then run to Indra subdued, in a childlike
        fashion. He &#8216;refreshes the streams&#8217; in imagery which almost sounds like
        contributing genetic material to a gene pool. But most interesting is the fact that
        these maids are &#8216;skilled in Law&#8217;, or rta. This description reinforces
        the association of rta with menstrual rhythms. These young women are &#8216;unwedded&#8217;,
        or not within a system of patriarchal marriage. Once impregnated they &#8216;flow
        forth&#8217; with much sought after Aryan offspring.</p>

        In RV 4.23.7-10 Indra turns his hand against an independent female spirit and the

    <p class="default">
        Commenting on stanza 8 Sayana writes &#8220;the word rta means Aditya, or Indra
        or sacrifice&#8221;, Griffith claims &#8220;its meaning varies slightly in this
        and the two following stanzas, but the original idea of regularity, conformity to
        or establishment by eternal order or law is found throughout&#8221;. About Rk 10
        Griffith claims the establisher of the law is also its upholder. Wilson translates
        &#8220;the worshipper subjecting rta to his will verily enjoys rta&#8221;.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Rk 8 relates rta with &#8216;food that strengthens&#8217;, O&#8217;Flaherty mentions
        that &#8220;the Vedic materials abound in texts in which semen is regarded as a
        form of food. Butter and honey, frequent metaphors for Soma come to be compared
        with semen&#8221;<sup><a href="#22">[22]</a></sup>. But in the context of this hymn,
        and following the interpretation that the menstrual rhythms are emblematic of cosmic
        rhythms, the &#8216;food that strengthens&#8217; may connote female fluid (in later
        texts female &#8216;seed&#8217;). During pregnancy, when menstruation ceases, that
        female blood is often understood to grow or &#8216;strengthen&#8217; the foetus.
        In the Rig Vedic hymn singers preoccupation with offspring, this &#8216;food&#8217;
        is also seen to strengthen the Aryan patriline. Within the context of the Vedic
        sacrifice that &#8216;food&#8217; becomes Soma. Perhaps within the previous ritual
        system of the indigenous &#8216;demon-priests&#8217;, like Vritra, female bodily
        fluids were considered the symbolic &#8216;food&#8217;.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Finally we must ask about the significance of the female demon in this passage.
        I would argue that the Aryan appropriation of a pre-existing social and symbolic
        form is a violent act; the indigenous reaction, and the continuation of non-Aryan
        ritual and social process is constructed in the Vedic text as an anathema, demonic.
        As we shall see with the demon of defloration in Suryaa&#8217;s Bridal and the demon-priest
        Vritra himself, it is entirely plausible to read the demonic as signifier for what
        is being excluded or forcefully appropriated by the emerging Aryan world-view.</p>
    <p class="default">
        This ambiguous meanings exist not just because of the multi-levelled planes of reality
        operating within the text, but also because the Vedic poets are switching back and
        forth attempting to reconcile conflicting symbolic and social systems of the pre-Vedic
        cosmic rta and the &#8216;new world order&#8217; of Aryan hegemony.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Within a Marxist interpretive frame work, N. N. Bhattacharyya suggests an alternative.
        but not mutually exclusive, meaning for the Vedic rta. He identifies gambling and
        dice, always heartily condemned in the canonical texts, with an ancient tribal redistribution
        system which was egalitarian, not hierarchical. His understanding provides another
        dimension to the phrase &#8216;food which strengthens&#8217; mentioned above.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Bhattacharyya writes that &#8220;Evidently dice were the symbol of ancient social
        justice and casting the lot was a means of equal distribution of wealth in early
        Vedic times&#8230;&#8221; I understand Bhattacharyya to be describing something
        like an ancient &#8216;kitty party&#8217; where the harvest or available resources
        were allocated via a game of chance. All would sooner or later receive their share,
        but the timing would depend on the throw of the dice.</p>
    <p class="default">
        As Bhattacharyya points out, rta cannot possibly only denote cosmological or natural
        laws because these laws would not have been subject to change. &#8220;There is no
        doubt that rta stood for a peculiar complex of moral and physical laws, but this
        is not all. Rta also stood for other principles&#8230;. One point which should be
        stressed is that the Vedic poets eventually felt the loss of rta and strongly urged
        for its revival. If it were exclusively the physical and cosmic laws, there was
        no need of such lamenting&#8230; &#8220;<sup><a href="#23">[23]</a></sup>.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Bhattacharyya proceeds to argue that &#8220;the Vedic rta must have originally been
        what Engels called &#8216;the simple moral grandeur of ancient gentile society&#8217;,
        and this explains why the Vedic poets felt the loss of rta for which the breakdown
        of ancient collective life was responsible&#8221;. He also notes the moral and ethical
        qualities originally attributed to the character of Varuna, friend to all and the
        guardian of rta. (These moral and ethical qualities of Varuna stand in complete
        opposition to the amorality of Indra.) Although Bhattacharyya&#8217;s Marxist methodology
        may seem obtrusive today, his scholarship stands. &#8220;Rigvedic passages relating
        to the rta convincingly prove that the said concept had direct or indirect bearing
        on the process of obtaining means of subsistence&#8221;.</p>
    <p class="default">
        N. N. Bhattacharyya thus provides a plausible explanation of the mechanism, the
        dice game, by which a pre-Vedic egalitarian society may have implemented distribution
        of resources. (Thematically the motif of the dice game is often linked with women
        in Hindu mythology. In the Uma-Maheshwar iconography Uma is depicted as winning
        a game of dice, beating an emaciated Shiva. In the famous dice game sequence of
        the Mahabharata, Draupadi is gambled away by her husband.)</p>
    <p class="default">
        Veena Das, in writing of Draupadi, has indicated that the motif of pollution is
        dominant in the rendering of her character. This pollution motif allows her to &#8220;reveal
        the dark side of the male codes of heroism and chivalry&#8221;<sup><a href="#24">[24]</a></sup>.
        According to Das the symbols of menstrual pollution were used by Draupadi to interrogate
        the male-centred events in the Mahabharata discourse. This irony would be even more
        pronounced if, in fact, the motif of the dice game hearkens back to a pre-existing
        moral order of rta in which women were not rendered as property and menstruation
        was not depicted as polluting.</p>
    <p class="default">
        It is relevant that at Mohenjodaro and other Harappan sites (which, as previously
        noted, some Indologists suggest may have been inhabited by the Dasas or demons of
        the Rig Veda) many small, cubed artifacts have been unearthed which archaeologists
        have called &#8216;dice&#8217;. In addition no system of coinage (for a city of
        60,000 inhabitants) has been found that is pre-Buddhist.</p>

        COLLECTIVE MOTHERS</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        The cows-waters-rivers-mothers cluster of imagery leads to a consideration of the
        group or collective mothers concept. D. D. Kosambi has written &#8220;There is,
        moreover, an ancient tradition of mothers-in-common that cannot be reconciled with
        Vedic father-right. It would be difficult to explain Panini 4.1.115 unless mother-in-common
        were taken for granted by the master grammarian.&#8221; Kosambi states that Tryambaka,
        which was later explained away as meaning &#8220;with three eyes&#8217; originally
        meant &#8216;with three mothers&#8217;. He suggests that this notion, which seems
        fantasy to the partrilineal mind, appears in &#8216;the legends of Jarasamdha born
        of two, and Jantu, born of a hundred mothers-in-common show&#8221;. According to
        Kosambi this demonstrates &#8220;that there was an undeniable tradition of many
        mothers with equal status, even for a single child&#8221;.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        Kosambi appropriately idedeflorationntifies this &#8216;mythology&#8217; as the
        historical patriarchal reworking of an original matrifocal culture. &#8220;These
        legends were meant to explain the record away when society had changed to the extent
        that the original concept seemed fantastic&#8230;. However, seen mothers who equally
        bear a child-in-common (without any particular father) is a primitive concept in
        some kinds of pre-patriarchal society, and the inexplicable notion is present even
        in the Rig Veda&#8221; <sup><a href="#16">[16]</a></sup>.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        Kosambi, although he gives no reference, may have been referring to RV 3.55:</p>
    <p class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">

        and &#8216;the lower and upper branches of the wood for the sacred fire&#8217;.
        But the reference to ancient sacrifices (which probably means ancient rituals) combines
        with the realistic domesticity of &#8220;one mother rests, another feeds the infant&#8221;

        The &#8216;road of Bhaga&#8217; is noted by Griffith as meaning &#8220;on the path
        of good fortune or felicity&#8221;. Actually one of the meanings of &#8216;bhaga&#8217;
        is vagina or yoni. The ancient conception seems to have been one of yoni as metaphoric
        source of all things, acknowledging the power and generativity of the female body.
        The Chieftain of the Mighty Stride&#8217; is Visnu as the sun. His mothers (plural),
        the many young Dames (plural), are, according to Sayana &#8220;the regions of space
        which generate all beings&#8221;. Here we encounter the Vedic (and probably pre-Vedic)
        notion of the generative power of air or space which is, within the text continually
        subordinated or appropriated by the power of Indra (lightning, seed, semenic rain)
        to create life.</p>

        Keith writes of the opposition of the gods to the demons or dasas. &#8220;That in
        many cases historic men may be meant when Dasas are overthrown is true; but gods
        of the defeated aborigines may also be denoted, and more generally powers of the
        air, opposed to the gods&#8221;. Keith explains that the Dasyus seek to scale heaven,
        but Indra vanquishes them from birth. Indra wins the sun and the waters after defeating
        them. Keith also mentions that &#8220;a Dasa is husband of the waters&#8230;&#8221;<sup><a
            href="#25">[25]</a></sup> further corroborating our socio-symbolic interpretation.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        In one context (RV 8.66.5) Vritra is referred to as a Gandharva, or celestial (air)
        being. &#8220;Indra in groundless realms of space pierced the Gandharva through,
        that he might make brahmans&#8217; strength increase&#8221;. This notion of generativity
        and sexuality (not involving patriarchal marriage or procreative intent) continues
        in the male-air-Gandharva, female water-Spsara personification of sexual elements.
        In the Arthashastra and Manusmriti the term &#8216;Gandharva marriage&#8217; refers
        to a love marriage, by mutual consent, which is not considered in the ideal or dharmic
        category. Manu commented that &#8220;it has sexual intercourse for it&#8217;s purpose&#8221;<sup><a
            href="#26">[26]</a></sup>.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        The acquiescence of the &#8216;cows-waters-women-mothers&#8217; to the designs of
        progeny-obsessed Aryans involved leaving behind her &#8216;airy fairy&#8217; consort
        (now symbolically killed by Indra) and accepting another model of generativity which
        located power-source-seed in the male god, in this case Agni (RV 3.57.3) &#8220;Fain
        to lend vigour to the Bull, the sisters with reverence recognize the germ within
        him&#8221;. Within the dominant patriarchal Aryan symbolic formulation, ideological
        justification for assimilation of the much needed indigenous women-mothers, it is
        the seed-germ which becomes sacralised and deposited in the stream mothers; the
        blood of women, and blood generally, is excluded or demonized.</p>

        BLOOD IN RIG VEDA</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        O&#8217;Flaherty in her analysis of &#8220;the origins of the sexual fluid hydraulic
        systems of Hindu texts&#8221; writes that blood is seldom mentioned in the Rig Veda
        &#8211; surprising for such an earthy and martial document. She mentions that &#8220;one
        late and notoriously problematic hymn ask, &#8216;Where is the earth&#8217;s breath,
        and blood and soul&#8217;?(RV 1:164:6)&#8221;. O&#8217;Flaherty points out the commentator
        Sayana&#8217;s anarchronistic understanding of this passage. Sayana &#8220;interprets
        this as a reference to the gross body (of earth and blood) and the subtle body (of
        breath and soul)&#8230; despite the probable anachronism of this interpretation,
        the Vedic text itself is certainly a clear reference to blood as the essence of
        the earthly body&#8221;<sup><a href="#22">[22]</a></sup>.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        This nostalgic paen to the &#8216;breath and blood and soul&#8217; of the earth,
        located in a hymn to Visvadevas, displays the Vedic poets&#8217; longing for the
        lost rta, as N. N. Bhattacharyya has noted. The text assigns equal value to the
        elements of earth, blood and soul which differs from the later Vedic hierarchical
        distinction of subtle body/gross body understood by Sayana.</p>

        the bony? Where is the blood of earth, the life, the spirit? Who may approach the
        man who knows to ask it?</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        Griffith and other commentators relate the bone less one to the unsubstantial, Prakriti
        or Nature and the source of the substantial, material world. Still common as a traditional
        image is the belief that the mother contributes the fleshy, unsubstantial material
        for the foetus, and the father contributes the bones. Patrilineal and patrilocal
        familial structure may be projected onto the body of the foetus in this Vedic notion
        of embryology.</p>

        (8) The mother gave the Sire has share of Order; with thought, at first, she wedded
        him, in spirit. She, the coy Dame was filled with dew prolific; with adoration men
        approached to praise her.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        The mother is identified as source, gifting the sire with his procreative function,
        share of order, rta, congruent with Dipak Bhattacharyya&#8217;s notion of the &#8216;obscured
        mothers of Agni&#8221;. The initial wedding exists in the realm of mind and spirit.
        She is subsequently impregnated by the dew prolific or semenic rains. This shift
        marks the transition from the matrifocal to the patriarchally constructed mother.</p>

        (15) Of the co-born they call the seventh single-born; the six twin pairs are called

    <p align="left" class="default">
        Griffith cites Wilson&#8217;s observation that the males/females reference is &#8216;a
        piece of grammatical mysticism &#8211; but there is nothing mystical about the formal
        transfiguration of seven &#8216;rivers&#8217; or gencalogies of women into seven
        families of rishis. Griffith himself demures &#8216;the meaning is obscure&#8217;.
        This rk may be an acknowledgement of the appropriation of metaphors of fertility
        and the substitution of the patriline for the matriline. The knowledge of the sage
        of being his father&#8217;s father operates on two levels: the pre-existing esoteric
        knowledge of all human life of divine origin &#8211; the lack of human paternity
        within a matristic system being attributed to a divine father, and the brahmanic
        construct of the pitrs or male ancestors who are continually reborn within the same
        patriline.</p>

        lament &#8211;something has been lost and that something relates to the blood and

        Although this hymn has been interpreted cosmologically, in relation to months, years,
        the sun, lightning, fire, dawn, etc. it is perfectly congruent with a socio-physiological
        reading.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        Another mention of blood (RV 1:87:16) refers to demons who are smeared with blood
        of men, horses and cattle and who steal away the milk of cows. This reference seems
        to reflect a practice of applying blood to the body. We can understand this literally
        as camouflage for cattle raiders or symbolically, as ritual practice using blood
        or both. In any case the reference clearly associates the demons with application
        of blood to the body.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        According to O&#8217;Flaherty &#8220;There is in the Rig Veda one veiled but highly
        charged reference to female sexual blood &#8211; not menstrual blood, but the blood
        of defloration&#8221;<sup><a href="#19">[19]</a></sup>. The divine prototype for
        patriarchal marriages is found in a passage referred to as &#8216;Suryaa&#8217;s
        Bridal&#8217;. Her Suryaa (the daughter of Surya, the sun) is wed to Soma &#8211;
        according to O&#8217;Flaherty the only time in the Rig Veda when Soma is regarded
        as the moon. Relevant portions of the hymn (RV 10:85) read:</p>
    <p align="left" class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
        (27) May happiness be fated for you here through your progeny. Watch over this house
        as mistress. Mingle your body with that of your husband&#8230;.
    </p>
    <p align="left" class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
        (28) The purple and red appears, a magic spirit; [Griffith translates &#8216;fiend&#8217;]

    <p align="left" class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
        (29) Throw away the gown, and distribute wealth to the priests. It becomes a magic

        (30) The body becomes ugly and sinisterly pale, if the husband with evil desire

        (34) It burns, it bites, and it has claws as dangerous a poison is to eat. Only

        (35) Cutting, carving, and chopping into pieces &#8211; see the colours of Surya
        which the priest alone purifies (RV 10:85:27:30, 34-35 trans O&#8217;Flaherty).</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        O&#8217;Flaherty comments that verses 28-30 and 34-35 concern the defloration of
        the bride and the staining of the bridal gown with her blood. She explains that
        &#8220;this blood becomes a magic spirit, potent and dangerous though not necessarily
        evil; the defloration is an auspicious event but too powerful to allow its emblem
        to remain present afterwards&#8221;. According to O&#8217;Flaherty the magical power
        of the blood of defloration is transferred to the bride&#8217;s family and to the
        husband, but it becomes evil if allowed to pollute the husband. Thus Soma performs
        a mediating function &#8220;by exercising his droit de seigneur. Soma takes upon
        himself the first and most powerful stigma of the blood of defloration&#8221;.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        O&#8217;Flaherty emphasizes the multiple meanings of stanza 33-35. Literally, of
        course, this verse describes the cutting up of the blood-stained robe: &#8220;but
        the words usually refer to the cutting up of the sacrificial animal, and there is
        a further overtone of the physical injury of the defloration itself, the sacrifice
        of the maidenhead on the altar of marriage&#8221;<sup><a href="#27">[27]</a></sup>.
        The hypothesis of a pre-existent matrifocal social order presupposes expression
        of female sexuality, unfettered by patriarchal marriage and not identified with
        the production of progeny for the patriline. The demon of defloration then can be
        read as a signifier for the violation of the independent and powerful feminine on
        many levels:</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        - The political because the institution of patriarchal marriage renders woman as
        an object of exchange.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        - The personal violence involved in the forcible breaking of the hymen of the newly-married
        girl.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        - The sexual as androcentric preoccupation with penetration, for example Urvashi&#8217;s
        reprimand of Puruvas&#8217; aggressive sexuality (RV 10.95.5 trans O&#8217;Flaherty
        &#8220;Indeed you pierced me with your rod three times a day and filled me even
        when I had no desire. I followed your will, Puruvas&#8230;&#8221;).</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        - The religio-symbolic in which the woman&#8217;s experience is excluded from determination
        of collective meaning, and she instead is rendered a cipher n an androcentric symbolic
        system. In this case, the textual analogy between the girl&#8217;s bloody garment&#8217;s
        and the sacrificial animal. (This demon of defloration bears a striking resemblance
        to the traditional popular notion of the churel &#8211; the demonic spirit of the
        woman who dies in childbirth.)</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        The demonisation of the blood of defloration demands the construction of a heroic
        masculine figure in order to, borrowing Uma Chakravarty&#8217;s phrase, &#8220;manage
        female sexuality&#8221;. Hence the priest does Soma&#8217;s work of &#8220;droit
        de seigneur&#8221; literally the right to &#8216;deflower&#8217; the &#8216;virgin&#8217;
        bride. I use the word &#8216;virgin&#8217; here in the patriarchal sense of unpenetrated,
        inexperienced sexually; not in it&#8217;s original sense of not belonging to any
        man &#8211; free, unexploited yet fecund as in contemporary usage, &#8216;a virgin
        forest&#8217;.)</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        I would argue that the defloration sequence located in Suryaa&#8217;s bridal involves
        a misreading or distortion of pre-existing esoteric knowledge <sup><a href="#28">[28]</a></sup>.
        This misreading subordinates other conceptions of the sacred masculine (linked with
        mountains, ethereal space, withholding of the waters, the Gandharva, the shamanic
        Vritra). The marriage-defloration passage in the tenth mandala is a late addition
        to the Rig Veda. All the citations regarding rta and the maidens, the collective
        mothers, and cows-water-women-mothers imagery are in the earlier family books. It
        may be that the earlier esoteric notions of the mystical generative power of women&#8217;s
        body, admittedly already defined in the masculine voice and rendered poetically
        and symbolically, in the tenth mandala become institutionally harnessed in the construction
        of the patriarchal marriage ritual.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        Suryaa, cosmically nominated as daughter of the Sun, is wed to Soma who, as O&#8217;Flaherty
        noted, is here linked with the moon for the only time in the Rig Veda. Suryaa, adorned
        with red flowers symbolic of menstruation, is encouraged to enter the world of patriarchal
        immortality (as the mother of sons), at the same time another male figure (Visvavasu,
        a Gandharva) is banished and her cosmic connection with Varuna (guardian or rta
        is severed (RV 10.85.21-25 trans O&#8217;Flaherty).</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        Mount the world of immorality, O Suryaa, that is adorned with red flowers&#8230;.
        Prepare an exquisite wedding voyage for your husband.</p>

        &#8216;Go away from here! For this woman has a husband&#8217;. Thus I implore Visvavasu
        with words of praise as I bow to him. &#8216;Look for another girl who is ripe and
        still lives in her father&#8217;s house. That is your birthright find it.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        &#8216;Go away from here Visvavasu, we implore you as we bow. Look for another girl,
        willing and ready. Leave the wife to unite with her husband&#8217;.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        May the roads be straight and thornless on which our friends go courting. May Aryaman
        and Bhaga united lead us together. Gods, may the united household be easy to manage.
        I free you from Varuna&#8217;s snare, with which the gentle Savitr bound you. In
        the seat of the Law, in the world of good action, I place you unharmed with your
        husband.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        I free her from here, but not from there. I have bound her firmly there, so that
        through the grace of Indra she will have fine sons and be fortunate in her husband&#8217;s
        love.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        The banishment of the Gandharva is another version of the slaying of Vritra. The
        woman&#8217;s role is now that of faithful wife and fecund mother of sons. All other
        male presence, earthly human or heavenly spirit, is banished so that the patrilineal
        household should be &#8216;easy to manage.&#8217;. Here the &#8216;seat of Law&#8217;
        or rta has become &#8220;the world of good action&#8221; or patriarchal dharma.
        Menstruation is depicted as a symbolic adornment rather than emblematic of cosmic
        rhythms.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        CHILD MARRIAGE</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        N. N. Bhattacharyya suggests that this and later texts have been used to justify
        child marriage. He claims that from Rig Vedic times (RV 10.85.40-41) there existed
        the belief that Soma, Gandharva and Agni were the divine guardians of a girl.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        Bhatttacharyya notes that in later texts &#8211; the Grhyasamgraha, quoted in the
        commentary on the Gobhila Grhyasutra (3.4.6) and Parakara Grhyasutra (1.4.16) &#8211;
        &#8220;Soma enjoys a girl when she develops her pubic hairs, Gandharva enjoys her
        when she develops her breasts and Agni enjoys her when she menstruates.&#8221; He
        understands this belief to be a mythological expression of primitive puberty rites
        which indicate that a girl was ceremonially deflowered by at least three individuals.
        According to Bhattacharyya &#8220;this myth was subsequently utilized by patriarchal
        lawmakers in order to explain and support the cause of child marriage and to declare
        that a girl must be married before she develops the signs of maturity&#8221;<sup>[29]</sup>.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        Bhattacharyya also states that in the Dharmasutra of Gautama it is prescribed that
        the girl should be given in marriage at puberty and she is only allowed to remain
        virgin until her third menstruation. He quotes from the Parasara Smriti (7.6-9).</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        A girl of eight is called Gauri; but one who is nine years old is a Rohini; one
        who is ten years old is a Kanya; beyond this one is a Rajavala (i.e. one who has
        had the experience of menstruation).</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        If a person does not give away a maiden when she has reached her twelfth year, his
        Pitrs (ancestors) will have to drink every month her menstrual discharge. The parents
        and also the eldest brother go to hell on seeing an unmarried girl becoming Rajasvala<sup><a
            href="#29">[29]</a></sup>.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        Such are the patriarchal constructions of previsous gynocentric esoteric knowledge.
        In the Parasara Smriti, as noted by Bhattacharyya, the brahmanical justification,
        not only for child marriage but also for enforced motherhood, is symbolically constituted
        in a threat to the &#8216;pitrs&#8217;. The notion, abhorrent to the brahmanic mind,
        that the ancestors might have to drink the girl&#8217;s monthly menstrual fluid
        suggests that this female bodily fluid may have been a part of the magic and ritual
        practice of the demon-priest. Thus, within the shastras, menstrual blood has drastically
        changed its symbolic valence from its Rig Vedic connection with generativity and
        cosmic order. Within the priestly meaning system this female blood becomes a threat
        to the patriarchal family and the father-ancestors.</p>
    <p align="left" class="lrgtxt2">
        FOOD</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        Interestingly, and unintentionally, we have uncovered various textual connections
        between food and menstruation. In the Dharmashastra taking food from the hand of
        the menstruating woman is forbidden. The rule presented for the twice born who recite
        the Veda is &#8220;Collyrium and ointment must not be accepted from her; for that
        is the food of women.&#8221; N. N. Bhattacharyya makes the point that within the
        Rig Veda the concept of rta is linked with the process by which means of subsistence,
        or food, is attained. &#8220;Eternal law has varied food which strengthens.&#8221;
        And in the Parasara Smriti the threat of the pitrs having to consume the menstrual
        blood of the unmarried girl relates to food. It is beyond the scope of this paper
        to examine and understand the implications of these references. However we suggest
        that ritual and belief systems, which define what is considered sacred and what
        is considered profane or demonic, provide the underlying rationale for any economic
        or socio-political system.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        The Dharmashastra reference presented at the beginning of this paper cites the Vedic
        origins of menstrual pollution in mythic terms: women assume the guilt of Indra&#8217;s
        brahmanicidal Vritra-slaying. As mentioned above there are many later Vedic, puranic
        and epic versions of both this killing and the subsequent distribution of Indira&#8217;s
        culpability. But in RV 4.18, a narrative of the birth and childhood deeds of Indra,
        there is merely a foreshadowing of the transference of Indra&#8217;s crime. In this
        hymn many of the motifs and concepts we have been exploring are interwined; the
        Vritra slaying, the waters-mothers-women imagery, the construction of the female
        body and motherhood, and the demonic or violated independent feminine. In this passage
        Indra refuses to be born through his mother&#8217;s vagina, even though she protests
        that a birth through her side will cause her death. Verbal articulation of the women/waters
        (independent feminine) who were &#8220;screaming like righteous women&#8221; is,
        within the narrative subordinated to onomatopoeia and praise for Indra &#8211; culminating
        in an indication that they will take on the sin of Indra. As in previous examples
        given above, this violation of the independent feminine is followed immediately
        by the appearance of a female demon who, as a split-off fragment of the character
        of Indra&#8217;s mother, plays a deeply ambivalent role in the narrative.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
        (1) (Indra&#8217;s mother): &#8220;This is the ancient proven path by which all
        the gods were born and moved upward. By this very path he should be born when he
        has grown great. He should not make his mother perish in that way.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
        (2) (Indra): &#8216;I cannot come out by that path; these are bad places to go through.
        I will come out cross-wise, through the side. Many things yet undone must I do;
        one I will fight and one I will question&#8217;&#8230;</p>
    <p align="left" class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
        (5) (Narrator): As if she thought he was flowed, his mother hid Indra though he
        abounded in manly strength. Then he stood up and put his garment on by himself;
        as he was born he filled the two world-halves.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
        (6) (Indra&#8217;s mother): &#8216;These waters flow happily, shouting &#8216;alala!&#8217;,
        waters that were screaming together like righteous women. Ask them what they are
        saying, what encircling mountain the waters burst apart.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
        (7) &#8216;Are they speaking words of praise and invitation to him? Do the waters
        wish to take on themselves the flow of Indra? With his great weapon my son killed
        Vritra and set these rivers free.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
        (8) &#8216;Still a young woman, I did not throw you away for my sake; nor did Evil-childbirth
        swallow you away for my sake. But for my sake the waters were kind to the child,
        and for my sake Indra stood up at once.&#8217;</p>
    <p align="left" class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
        (9) &#8216;Not for my sake did the shoulderless one wound you generous Indra, and
        strike away your two jaws&#8217; through wounded, you overpowered him, and with
        your weapon you crushed the head of the Dasa.&#8217;</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        O&#8217;Flaherty&#8217;s understanding of this passage is linked to &#8220;it&#8217;s
        place in Indo-European mythology; it refers, in purposely mysterious tones to the
        story of a male god concealed by his mother from a father who threatens to kill
        a father whom he himself then kills&#8221;<sup><a href="#27">[27]</a></sup>. A woman-centred
        interpretation would, however, foreground the threat to the mother, the role of
        the waters-women in taking on Indra&#8217;s guilt and the female demon.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        In stanza 1 Indra&#8217;s mother pleads for a conventional birth and fears her own
        death in the birth from her side. Mythically Indra&#8217;s choice of being born
        from his mother&#8217;s side can be read as a rejection of the centrality and sacrality
        of the yoni as generative source. On the level of social and familial grouping the
        matriline is rejected for the patriline. (This shift also marks the beginning of
        the Oedipal violence between father and son.)</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        In rk 2 Indra actually says that the paths of the vagina or yoni &#8220;are bad
        places to go through&#8221; confirming the desacralisation of the female body and
        the mysogeny inherent in his character. He speaks of his heroic destiny of fighting
        Vritra and questioning someone whose identity is not clear. (O&#8217;Flaherty suggests
        Vishnu or Tvastr.)</p>

        O&#8217;Flaherty notes &#8220;The flow may be a physical birth flow &#8230;this
        suspicion is invalid. Indra is not physically flowed. But the phrase may also foreshadow
        the moral flaw which is to be a problem to Indra, the guilt of the slaughter of
        Vritra, alluded to in verse 7.&#8221; If we take the slaying of Vritra as the symbolic
        equivalent of the decline of matrifocal social groupings and the desacralisation
        of the independent cosmic feminine then the holistic meaning of this hymn is clear.
        Indra&#8217;s flaw (which his own mother recognized as a threat to her life) is
        his independence of a matrifocal moral order, his strength and tendency towards
        violence: his violent birth, his violent dismemberment of Vritra, his slaying of
        his own father &#8211; indeed his rupture of a pre-existing, peaceable, matristic
        social and symbolic order.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        The issue within this violence then becomes protection. Indra&#8217;s mother, within
        the context of the Vedic hymn, first functions to protect Indra (both from his father
        and from his own violent character) and then abandons him to the protection of the
        waters.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        In stanza 6 Indra&#8217;s mother speaks of the waters who are now flowing happily
        and onomatopoetically. Through Indra&#8217;s mother&#8217;s words the waters are
        rendered in the male voice symbolically constructed as free and happy. But previously
        they were &#8220;screaming together like righteous women&#8221;. O&#8217;Flaherty
        succumbs to androcentric perspective and reads this as referring to screaming for
        help when Vritra assaults them. But nowhere in any version of the Rig Veda have
        I read of imagery which speaks of Vritra&#8217;s &#8216;assault&#8217; on the waters/women.
        Vritra encloses, contains and lies with the waters, but does not assault them. I
        read &#8216;screaming together like righteous women&#8217; as the protest of the
        violated feminine/females which is silenced (by the poets) and then becomes poetically
        and aesthetically rendered. The text itself acknowledges the problem of interpreting
        the message of the waters. &#8220;Ask them what they are saying&#8230;&#8221;</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        In stanza 7 Indra&#8217;s mother continues in a tentative and questioning voice
        betraying the ambivalence of the shifting positions of the waters from righteous
        protest to gurgling poesy, to praise and invitation, to willingness to take on Indra&#8217;s
        guilt. And again the Vritra slaying is mentioned as releasing the waters.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        In stanzas 8 and 9 Indra&#8217;s mother repeatedly uses the phrases &#8216;not for
        my sake&#8217; and for my sake indicating that she may be faulted for the motivation
        of her actions. First she claims that her rejection of Indra as a child, and his
        subsequent swallowing by the demon-childbirth was &#8216;not for her sake&#8217;.
        (According to Sayana, &#8216;demon-childbirth&#8217; was Kusava, a rakshasi who
        swallowed Indra at his birth, and Roth states this reference is the name of river
        &#8211; again the river-women-mothers, in this case demonic, imagery.) But Indra&#8217;s
        mother will take credit for the waters nurturing the child and his own independence.
        The question of acting in one&#8217;s own self-interest is operative here; Indra
        triggers the entire drama by rejecting birth through the vagina and endangering
        his mother. She reacts ambivalently, by rejecting him &#8211; but &#8220;not for
        her own sake&#8221;.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        She distances herself from the swallowing evil-childbirth (obviously symbolic of
        the rejected power of the (&#8216;yoni&#8217;) and in the next stanza proceeds to
        distance herself from the shoulderless one (Vritra) who is said to have not acted
        for her sake. Why the need for this disavowal of both demon-childbirth and Vritra
        unless both are linked to her rage at her son&#8217;s heroic strength which threatens
        and marginalizes her? But she also allies herself with the nurturing waters and
        Indra&#8217;s independence because these are congruent with the construction of
        the heroic masculine and maternal feminine, ultimately espoused by the Vedic poets.
        The contradictory nature of the maternal waters is a continuing theme throughout
        later texts and mythology.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        As O&#8217;Flaherty notes &#8220;none of the principals in the drama is named except
        Indra; later commentary identifies the mother with Aditi and the father with Tvastr&#8221;.
        &#8220;I would argue that Indra&#8217;s mother has no name here because she is still
        generic for Mother &#8211; or more appropriately within the early Vedic period &#8211;
        Kosambi&#8217;s &#8216;mothers-in-common&#8221;&#8217;. She is singular only because
        she is the mother of Indra and thus patriarchally constructed. But the hymn is &#8216;permeated
        by her deep ambivalence towards her hero-son.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        Women taking on the sin of Indra, in the form of their menstrual blood, elaborated
        on in the later texts, is only hinted at the Rig Veda. But Indra&#8217;s avoidance
        of his mother&#8217;s yoni, and the silencing or symbolic construction of the waters/women
        are narrative elements which precede the suggestion that they will absorb his culpability.</p>
    <p align="center" class="lrgtxt2">
        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">III</font></p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        Thus within the Rig Veda the elemental and numinous power of the feminine/female
        is nominated symbolized, appropriated &#8211; managed and controlled. Vedic gender
        categories of primal female power are constructed. Those able to be controlled are
        designated as sacred &#8211; Vac (the word), and &#8216;Aditi&#8217; (patriarchal
        motherhood). Those more difficult to manage are demonized- Nritti (death), Danu
        and Diti (mothers of the aboriginal peoples) or raped, Ushas (independent cosmological
        feminine). The earlier elemental imagery of cows-waters-maid-mothers is replaced
        by the patriarchal institution of marriage in Suryaa&#8217;s bridal hymn from Book
        Ten. Rta, cosmic order is subordinated to dharma, right action, as defined and elucidated
        by the emerging priestly caste.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        The patriarchal synthesis effected by the Vedic poets involved the construction
        of a symbolic structure which glorified women in their role of mothers and simultaneously
        excluded or mystified and demonized the female biological fluid of blood. Imagery
        of cows-waters-women-mothers facilitated articulations of feminine generativity
        which were developed into mechanisms of social and symbolic control of female sexuality.
        Both the religious ritual of the sacrifice and the social grouping of the patrilineal
        family structurally reflect a focus on the masculine figures of Indra and Agni as
        the source of scared authority, object of ritual practice, and dominant biological
        metaphor.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        The mythic slaying of Vritra, son of the mother, symbolizes this paradigmatic shift
        from the female body to the male body as principle social and symbolic metaphor.
        The generative female power of childbirth is eclipsed by the sacrificial dismemberment
        of the cosmic male; it is out of Purusha&#8217;s body which the world is created
        &#8211; the Vedic, androcentric world, that is.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        My initial investigation was prompted by the seemingly contradictory attitudes towards
        the female body displayed by the basti women&#8217;s rituals of well worship after
        childbirth and observations of menstrual taboos. The Dharmashastra outline of menstrual
        prohibitions and beliefs linked this practice to the Vedic myth of Indra slaying
        Vritra. I was not familiar with any textual or historical sources which would give
        information about the well worship ritual so my efforts have been to detect an alternative
        positive valence to water as sacred source rather than merely ritual purification
        or washing away sins within the context of the Rig Veda.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        My working hypothesis of pre-existing meaning systems and matristic indigenous kinship
        groupings evolved into a methodology of a socio-physiological reading of the text.
        A foregrounding of Vritra reveals his, and all demons, matrilineal origins, linkage
        to the transformative elements of air, water, and earth (as opposed to the Indra-Agni
        element of fire)., and ritual function as demon-priest. The symbolic nexus of cows-waters-women-mothers,
        read within the historical context of Aryan assimilation of indigenous women and
        concern with progeny, validates this socio-physiological interpretation. Dipak Bhattacharya&#8217;s
        analysis of &#8220;the flow of Rta from the obscured mothers of Agni&#8221; and
        Kosambi&#8217;s work on the collective mothers, point toward the fact of the patrilineal
        superordination of the matrilineal in both social and symbolic realms. O&#8217;Flaherty&#8217;s
        treatment of the symbolic element of blood, its exclusion from the demonisation
        wthin the text, facilitates an understanding of the later brahmanic symbolic valence
        of menstrual blood.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        Finally the deeply ambivalent role of both Indra&#8217;s mother and the waters,
        in the hymn narrating Indra&#8217;s birth (which also hints at the water&#8217;s
        taking on the guilt of Indra&#8217;s Vritra slaying), provides a mythic understanding
        of the contradictory constructions of woman&#8217;s body found in the basti woman&#8217;s
        ritual practice. The worship of the well as yonic source of life is congruent with
        the early Rig Vedic waters-women-mothers cluster of imagery. If Rta was, in fact,
        a signifier for both a moral and a cosmic order (for which menstrual and lunar rhythms
        were emblems) then it is understandable that a patriarchal priesthood needed to
        subordinate the control, via ideological construction of woman&#8217;s body, that
        powerful primal female force. The emerging brahmanic symbolic and social order created
        oppositional categories: Indra-Vritra, gods-demons, fire-blood, man-woman, twice-born-shudra,
        purity-pollution, death-immortality.</p>

        esoteric or mystical knowledge is literalised and transformed into an instrument
        of domestication and social control. He writes about the ritual of castration in
        which priests offered up their paternity to the culture of the Great Mother.</p>
    <p align="left" class="default">
        <span class="smltxt2">&#8220;Castration of bulls was a socialization process that turned
            a bull into an ox; in this transformation something wild became something very useful;
            nature became culture. This knowledge thus became a way in which the wild knowledge
            of paternity could be converted to a useful function &#8211; the rise of the priesthood.
            Castration is an obsessive form of behaviour; it is an institution way of taking
            literally and concretely something the solitary shaman would know to be metaphoric
            for initiatic and secret states of consciousness. Just such a priestly translation
            of shamanistic knowledge took place in the Mexico of the Aztecs. In the yoga of
            Quetzalcoatl, the initiate spoke of the opening of the heart to the light of the
            sun and what was meant by this was the opening of the charkas in the subtle body:
            the Aztec priests, as voices for collectivization, took the esoteric words literally,
            ripping out the victim&#8217;s physical heart and holding it up to the sun. The
            castration of men seems to represent a similar misreading of esoteric knowledge&#8230;&#8221;
