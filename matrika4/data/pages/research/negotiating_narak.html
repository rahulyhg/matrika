            Introduction</p>
    </div>
    <p class="default">
        This paper attempts to &#8220;apprehend the voices of women who situate their experience
        within a religious framework.&#8221; More specifically, it is trying to understand
        the voices of indigenous midwives as they speak about their ethno-medical work with
        childbearing women. It is based on the presupposition that the package of services
        traditionally delivered to women during parturition is part and parcel of an ethno-medical
        and religio-cultural heritage. Another assumption is that indigenous midwives and
        the women whom they serve are knowers and decision makers operating within a health
        knowledge framework that is different from, but not inferior to, modern allopathic
        medicine. Furthermore, these midwives have been systematically devalued and marginalized
        since colonial times, in part, because they make no distinction between the modern,
        mutually exclusive categories of &#8216;medicine&#8217; and &#8216;religion&#8217;.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Traditional midwives, or <i>dais</i> as they are called in North India, attend over
        half of the births in India, however, with the notable exception of the women and
        communities they serve, they are not recognized and appreciated for the services
        they provide. With some slight variations, throughout Hindi speaking North India,
        <i>dais</i>&#8217; patron deity is called <i>bemata</i>. Educated, English speaking
        urbanites know little about these <i>dais</i>, about their knowledge of the female
        body or their ethno-medical skills and practices. Nor do we know about the ritual
        performances which support their midwifery work and enact a <i>bemata</i> theology.
        This paper is an initial incursion into the divine, but also potentially demonic,
        persona of <i>bemata</i> and her significance to <i>dais</i> and the poor whose
        births they attend. I also attempt a gender and caste sensitive exploration of the
        meanings of <em>Narak</em>, the &#8220;hell&#8221; or demonic place, where <i>bemata</i>
        dwells.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Rarely have research findings generated by extensive, collective and &#8216;subaltern&#8217;
        investigations been utilized as primary data for scholarship in religious studies.
        The ethnographic data in this paper is drawn from three years of research by MATRIKA,
        (Motherhood and Traditional Resources, Information, Knowledge and Action)&#8212;an
        effort to document, interpret and analyze traditional midwives&#8217; ethno-medical
        and religio-cultural traditions. The MATRIKA team has learned of these practices
        in three years of workshops with <i>dais</i> in Bikaner District of Rajasthan; Gomia,
        Bihar; Fategarh District in Punjab and the resettlement colonies of Delhi. We have
        explored <i>dais</i>&#8217; knowledge and practice through discussions and interviews,
        role plays and ritual drawings, body mappings and <em>sohars</em> or birth songs.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        This paper also explores textual material relating to the context of <i>bemata</i>.
        <i>dais</i> refer to the postpartum period as &#8220;narak ka samay&#8221; or hellish
        or demonic time. And narak is also spoken of as the underground and fertile realm
        where <i>bemata</i> dwells<sup><a href="#3" class="contentlinksbold">3</a></sup>.
        Thus I draw on Puranic and Ayurvedic literature to use as interpretive lenses through
        which I view the <i>dais</i>&#8217; mappings of the female body, ritual practice
        and descriptions of <i>bemata</i>. Gender sensitive scholarship, however, must foreground
        the power relationships that existed during the times the texts were generated,
        recited and written down. I exercise a feminist hermeneutical suspicion on the Puranic
        meanings of <em>narak</em>, especially because the <i>dais</i> use the term without
        distaste or moral judgment. Velcheru Rama Rao describes the complex weaving of the
        &#8216;subaltern&#8217; with Braminic ideology within Puranic literature.</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        Vast bodies of folk/regional stories, events, legends, and histories have been incorporated
        into the Puranas along with prescriptive codes of behavior appropriate to people
        of different stations of life. Such incorporation has made a Brahminic interpretation
        of the material possible without necessarily erasing the local color and regional
        flavor<sup><a href="#4" class="contentlinksbold">4</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Probing, not to mention theorizing the &#8216;subaltern&#8217; is not an easy task.
        Modern institutions and academic disciplines since colonial times have increasingly
        marginalized <i>dais</i>, in part, because they cannot comprehend them. As poor,
        illiterate and mostly low and outcaste women, their health knowledge and practice
        has been denigrated and invisiblised<sup><a href="#5" class="contentlinksbold">5</a></sup>.
        We have allowed the categories of religion and medicine to intertwine&#8212;and
        adapted our research methodologies to grapple with these indigenous, holistic childbirth
        and healing modalities. We have also resisted the dominant modern perspective that
        labels <i>dais</i>&#8217; ways of knowing and practices as ignorance and &#8216;superstition&#8217;.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        For 15 years I have been puzzled by the seeming contradictions which I have encountered
        when researching the indigenous childbirth knowledge and practice of <i>dais</i>
        and the women they serve. On the one hand they use expressions such as <em>nau mahena
        </em>ka<em> narak kund</em> (nine months&#8217; hell spring or pond) for the afterbirth
        (placenta, cord and membranes) and traditionally have observed what we call &#8216;pollution
        taboos&#8217; (not doing <em>puja</em>, going to the<em> mandir</em> or reading
        holy books)<sup><a href="#6" class="contentlinksbold">6</a></sup> during menstruation
        or postpartum. On the other hand the same women report empowering birth rituals
        both during labour and the post birth period. Multiple perspectives on the significance
        of <em>narak </em>reveal the deeply gendered cultic tensions and power relations
        which have existed on the Indian subcontinent for millennia.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Thus the second section of the paper explores textual references to narak found
        in the Puranic literature. Not surprisingly, at the time of birth,<i>dais</i> speak
        of narak with a different voice than the Brahmins do in the Puranic literature.
        This difference raises questions of inter-textuality or the interrelationship between
        the concept of <em>narak</em> in women&#8217;s birth ritual and idiom and in that
        of dominant sacred texts. When we examine <i>dais</i>&#8217; ritual &#8216;texts&#8217;
        and expressed world views, questions arise about meanings and contexts: oral sources
        vs. written sources; low caste vs. high caste attitudes towards the female body;
        sex and procreative power; female as opposed to male ritual specialists. Notions
        of divine and demonic female power are radically differently confi<i>gur</i>ed in
        these two sets of texts (oral vs. written), based, I would suggest, on the differently
        situated social and religious roles of the practitioner. But questions remain to
        the modern, or postmodern, researcher: &#8220;How can we understand <i>dais</i>&#8217;
        use of such seemingly derogatory terms as narak at the time of menstruation and
        childbirth?&#8221; Why do <i>dais</i> themselves refer to the cutting of the umbilical
        cord as a great paap or sin?&#8221; &#8220;What light can a review of the meanings
        of <em>narak</em> in the Puranas shed on <i>dais</i>&#8217; use of the concept?&#8221;
        These questions necessitate the foregrounding of a complex network of gender-caste-power
        relations and the reclamation of the subordinated knowledge and theological systems
        of poor, low caste and non-literate women.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Such a reclamation effort, however, requires putting aside the assumption, often
        shared by both researcher and religious elite, that spiritual power entails ritual
        purity<sup><a href="#7" class="contentlinksbold">7</a></sup>. The midwife has not
        been seen in the Indian context as a ritual specialist and a resource for sacred
        knowledge, or in anyway related to &#8220;spiritual&#8221; activity, precisely because
        female bodily fluids have been deemed by the dominant Hindu textual tradition as
        antithetical to spiritual power and practice.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Rita Gross, theologian and scholar of religion, confronted this assumption in a
        perceptive essay in 1980. In &#8220;Menstruation and Childbirth as Ritual and Religious
        Experiences among Native Australians&#8221; she deconstructs previous anthropological
        scholarship on aboriginal Australian menstruation and birth rites. This allowed
        her to view female rites, not as profane adjuncts to men&#8217;s central spiritual
        ritual practices, but as displaying a uniquely female and embodied spirituality.
        Gross emphasized the &#8220;&#8230;extreme sexual differentiation that characterizes
        religious life in aboriginal Australia<sup><a href="#8" class="contentlinksbold">8</a></sup>&#8221;
        She noted &#8220;&#8230;women are almost completely excluded from the men&#8217;s
        rituals; and&#8212;although this aspect has been much less noticed&#8212;men are
        completely excluded from women&#8217;s rituals.&#8221; Androcentric anthropological
        scholarship thus has focused on male rites and</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        &#8230;this situation led to the classic interpretation of sexual dichotomy in aboriginal
        religion: masculinity is inextricably woven with ritual cleanliness and femininity
        is equally intertwined with the concept of uncleanness, the former being the sacred
        and the latter profane&#8230;This idea of &#8220;profaneness&#8221; also led many
        scholars to downplay the religious significance of women&#8217;s rituals<sup><a href="#9"
            class="contentlinksbold">9</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Gross points out that precisely because these ceremonies are different from men&#8217;s,
        they are centered on women&#8217;s unique experiences (i.e. bodily experience) and
        perform the same function for women that men&#8217;s rituals perform for men. Women
        express and <i>atta</i>in their adult status as sacred beings via their particularly
        female ritual experience. She asserts that the experiences and rituals of menstruation
        and childbirth, were they found in any other domain, would automatically be deemed
        by researchers as &#8220;sacred&#8221; or &#8220;religiously significant&#8221;.
        These marks of sacrality are: first exclusiveness and secrecy; second, both possess
        similar ideological or narrative underpinnings; and third, basic ritual patterns
        with initiatory structure of withdrawal, seclusion, and return&#8212;thought of
        in terms of death and rebirth. Although Indian culture undoubtedly differs radically
        from that of aboriginal Australia, all of these marks of sacrality are present in
        women&#8217;s indigenous Indian birth culture.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        When women and men participate in common rituals, as in all of the dominant religions,
        the special female experiences of the body, become inserted in a male-centered,
        often abstract, conceptual or &#8216;mystical&#8217; ritual or praxis domain&#8212;leaving
        behind uniquely female bodily experiences and religio-cultural customs which celebrate
        it. The internal logic of <i>dais</i>&#8217; ethno-medical and religio-cultural
        practice proceeds from ways of perceiving and knowing which can be legitimately
        termed &#8216;theological&#8217;. They follow a chain of reasoning and use causal
        linkages embedded in the divine and sometimes demonic figure of <i>bemata</i>. Furthermore
        <i>dais</i>&#8217; epistomology and ontology are entirely congruent with other indigenous
        systems such as Tantra, Yoga and Ayurveda. A gender sensitive perspective requires
        questioning why sophisticated and holistic body-spirit knowledge and practice are
        acknowledged within these systems-- but when it comes to knowledge and &#8216;spirituality&#8217;
        related to the female body, <i>dais</i> are perceived as ignorant and superstitious.</p>
    <p class="default">
        In dealing with the information we have received about <i>bemata</i> and narak,
        however, we are not in the realm of the analytical thought of systematic theology,
        nor are we dealing with Brahminic textual exegesis. Rather we are attempting a sympathetic
        and imaginative interpretation of a uniquely female form of religiosity encoding
        cultural knowledge and truths about female physiological process. We can only access
        <i>bemata</i> theology through <i>dais</i>&#8212;their ritual performances; understandings
        which have been orally transmitted; and childbirth expertise which has been garnered
        via apprenticeship. <i>dais</i> are ritual as well as ethno-medical specialists
        and are cultural repositories of attitudes, skills and practices which are shared
        by the communities of women whom they serve.</p>
    <p class="default">
        As Kalpana Ram notes above, we face the epistomologically challenging task, of listening
        to and attempting to comprehend women who relate the realities of their lives in
        a &#8216;religious&#8217; idiom. And this exercise is particularly perplexing in
        that to the pre-modern and postmodern mind categories of religion and medicine are
        simultaneous. To this point the anthropologist Frederique Apfel Marglin&#8217;s
        analysis of the role of worship of the Goddess Sitala in indigenous prophylaxis
        against smallpox is comparable to <i>bemata</i>&#8217;s role in childbirth.
    </p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        Today the adjective &#8216;non-scientific&#8217; is often used synonymously with
        &#8216;irrational&#8217;. A system of knowledge which makes no distinction between
        naturalistic forms of explanations and religious forms of explanation is deemed
        irrational and inferior&#8230;.Smallpox in modern medical discourse is a disease,
        and health is the absence of disease&#8230;Smallpox in non-modern India is a goddess
        who is both the presence and the absence of the disease. Goddess Sitala is both
        the disease and its cure or its absence, health<sup><a href="#10" class="contentlinksbold">10</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Gendered hierarchies, as well as modernity, are implicated in the problem of decoding
        the significance of such deities as Sitala and <i>bemata</i> which confound us.
        &#8220;Because of the masculine bias of our sources, especially the textual traditions,
        the construction of notions of the Divine Feminine within these sources tend to
        privilege conceptions of women&#8217;s identity/roles and images of the Devi which
        are in accord with the prevailing (or emerging) patriarchal ideology. Conceptions
        which defy such ideology are marginalized, excluded or rendered &#8216;demonic&#8217;.<sup><a
            href="#11" class="contentlinksbold">11</a></sup>
        <br />
        This paper suggests the reclamation of <i>dais</i>&#8217; cultural handling of birth
        is problematic in that both modern &#8216;scientific&#8217; medicine and dominant
        indigenous theological notions converge to devalue it.

        &#8216;Narak&#8217; as the Unseen and Fertile Inner World of the Earth and of the
        Female Body</p>
    <p class="default">
        <i>bemata</i> dwells in the realm of<em> narak</em>, deep within the earth<sup><a
            href="#12" class="contentlinksbold">12</a></sup>. She is a Creatrix responsible
        for the conception, growth within the womb, and birth of human beings as well as
        the growth of all vegetation. During the first workshop in Gomia, Bihar one<em> dai</em>
        explained the meaning of <em>narak</em> to us in terms of menstruation and postpartum:</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        Girls are considered holy before puberty. The marriage of a young girl (who has
        not had her periods) is performed with her sitting on her father&#8217;s lap. After
        puberty the woman is considered unclean, and is unholy, because she bleeds, and
        this is <em>narak</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        On <em>Chhati </em>day (after birth) the <em>narak period</em> ends. The Dai checks
        if the umbilical cord has fallen off. Then she bathes the baby and beats a <em>thaali</em>
        (plate) and gives the baby to Chachi (husband&#8217;s younger brother&#8217;s wife).
        <em>Chachi</em> does <em>Namaskar</em> to God and gives the baby to <em>Jethani</em>
        (husband&#8217;s elder brother&#8217;s wife). Then the woman is bathed and she wears
        new clothes. The Dai then cleans the room where the delivery took place and the
        mother was kept separately for six days.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Although often translated as hell or demonic place, <em>narak</em> can be understood
        as the site or energy of the unseen inner world - of the earth and of the body.
        <em>Narak </em>has the connotation &#8216;filth&#8217; but also signifies the fertility
        or fruitful potential of the earth and woman&#8217;s body. So called &#8216;pollution
        taboos&#8217; are related to narak, in that the idea of the sacred is radically
        separated from the reproductive potential of the female body. During menstruation
        and post birth women are considered &#8216;unclean&#8217;. However the dai speaks
        with a very different voice than the pundit about narak. To her the placenta, the
        ultimate polluting substance to caste Hindus or the &#8220;twice born&#8221;, is
        spoken of reverently, as &#8216;another mother&#8217;. It is no coincidence that
        <i>dais</i> are mainly from low and outcaste communities. Both caste and gender
        are involved in concepts of narak. (Ayurvedic and naturopathic practitioners often
        employ low caste people to apply the hands-on therapies they prescribe). And interestingly
        in our MATRIKA team&#8217;s analysis of birth time (which in obstetrical terminology
        is referred to as &#8216;labour&#8217;, &#8216;birth&#8217; and &#8216;postpartum&#8217;)
        we adopted the <i>dais</i>&#8217; language of &#8216;the opening body&#8217;, &#8216;the
        open body&#8217;, and &#8216;the closing body&#8217;. <em>Narak</em> thus can be
        viewed as representing &#8216;the open body&#8217;. This is the time when what is
        normally closed, is open, or the liminal and dangerous time/space of generative,
        female bodily processes<sup><a href="#13" class="contentlinksbold">13</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Narak also functions as a basic ethno-medical idea, providing a conceptual framework
        for a host of non-invasive therapeutic interventions. Narak signifies the inner
        world of the body, particularly to the mysterious creative power of the female body
        (and simultaneously the earth body) which is invisible to the human eye. This concept
        allows for a mode of understanding facilitating non-invasive diagnostics and therapeutics.
        <i>dais</i> practice gentle techniques which negotiate and affect the inner body
        without violating the integrity of the skin/body/life force. And indeed the <i>dais</i>&#8217;
        holistic health modalities utilize touch (massage, pressure, manipulation) and natural
        resources (mud, baths and fomentation, herbs) and application of &#8216;hot and
        cold&#8217; (in food and drink, fomentation etc.) and isolation and protection (from
        domestic, maternal and sexual obligations).</p>
    <p class="default">
        Feminist studies of religious injunctions about female bodily fluids, particularly
        the blood of menstruation and childbirth, have focused on the &#8216;taboos&#8217;
        which dictate women&#8217;s behavior and define attitudes towards her as &#8216;impure&#8217;
        and not fit for religious activities. However, from the woman-centered dai&#8217;s
        perspective, this blood is bad, not because it is threatening to men or polluting.
        It is &#8216;bad&#8217; because it must be expelled from the woman&#8217;s body
        because it is potentially dangerous for her&#8212;it is no longer needed in her
        body and pathology will result if it remains within the body. In the context of
        postpartum care, the <i>dais</i> link narak and <i>bemata</i> to the &#8216;bad
        blood&#8217; or that energy of the maternal body which is associated with growing
        the baby&#8212;signified by the &#8216;black blood&#8217;. And this blood, the mark
        of that energy, is a diagnostic tool. It must leave the mother&#8217;s body post-birth
        or pathology will result. Menstruation also is perceived to perform a cleansing
        function in the body since menstrual blood contains &#8216;impurities&#8217; which
        must be eliminated in order to maintain balance in the body.</p>
    <p class="default">
        <span class="lrgtxt2">Who is <i>bemata</i>?<sup><a href="#14" class="contentlinksbold">14</a></sup></span></p>
    <p class="default">
        <i>bemata</i> is not like Durga or Saraswati, Lakshmi or even Santoshi Ma. To my
        knowledge there exist no temples, pilgrimage sites, texts, icons relating to <i>bemata</i><sup><a
            href="#15" class="contentlinksbold">15</a></sup>, nor does she have a place
        in the ritual calendar. She cannot even be said to be aniconic&#8212;found in the
        form of a stone or a cave. If she represents anything, it is female reproductive
        physiology. As mentioned above she manifests as both a creative and a destructive
        force&#8212;procreativity while growing the baby, and pathology if she does not
        leave when her work is done.</p>
    <p class="default">
        I first encountered <i>bemata</i> 15 years ago in a collaborative research project
        with NGOs documenting women&#8217;s experiences of childbearing<sup><a href="#16"
            class="contentlinksbold">16</a></sup>. In these interviews, conducted by health
        workers who were themselves <em>basti </em>residents, women spoke of <i>bemata</i>
        as she was invoked during a ritual I call &#8220;the cutting of the <i>atta</i>&#8221;.
        Moti Dai describes the rite invoking <i>bemata</i> emphasizing that the dai, herself,
        is empowered by <i>bemata</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        There is the custom of cutting the <i>atta</i> or rice. When the labour pains have
        come and the<em> dai </em>has arrived, the <em>jachcha</em> puts both hands full
        of <i>atta</i> in the <em>thali</em>. The dai holds the wrist of the mother while
        she, with her hand, separates the <i>atta</i> into two parts from the middle. <i>bemata</i>
        is worshipped by putting money and <i>gur</i> on top of the <i>atta</i>, offering
        it to the dai, and saying &#8220;In this way separate the mother and the child so
        that the child is born without any difficulty.&#8221; It is said that when <em>Ram</em>
        and <em>Lakshman</em> were born <i>bemata</i> herself came and acted as dai. Now
        it&#8217;s the dai, herself, who represents the shakti of <i>bemata</i>. (<em>Moti Dai</em>&#8212;an
        upper caste midwife)</p>
    <p class="dafault">
        <span class="default"><em>Moti </em>Dai, a rare high caste midwife, connects the ritual
            with the midwife who assisted Sita at Ram and Lakshman&#8217;s births. Shakina<em> Dai</em>,
            a Muslim midwife, mentions offerings to <em>Sayyid</em>, an Islamic figure, but
            similarly invokes <i>bemata</i>. She also refers to the labouring woman as having
            one foot in heaven and the other in <em>narak </em>or hell.</span></p>
    <p class="dafault">
        <span class="default">Look, sister, at the time of birth it&#8217;s only the woman&#8217;s

            Before doing a delivery I.get the woman to open all the trunks, doors and so on.
            I pray to the One Above to open the knot quickly. I take off the sari, open the
            hair and take off the bangles or any jewellery. I put the <i>atta</i> on a thali
            and ask the woman to divide it into two equal parts. Also I get Rs.1.25 in the name
            of Sayyid kept separately. But mostly I remember <i>bemata</i>. Repeatedly I pray
            to the <i>bemata</i> &#8220;Oh mother! please open the knot quickly.&#8221; (<em>Shakina

        <span class="default"><i>dais</i> from all religions have invoked <i>bemata</i>. In
            workshops in the Punjab, Mazbi (outcaste) Sikh <i>dais</i> said that they, too,
            pray to <i>bemata</i>. My initial analysis of the ritual, written 10 years ago,
            probes the representational dimensions of the splitting of the <i>atta</i> in terms
            of the imagistic analogy between the female body and the earth.</span></p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        When I first encountered this ritual splitting of the <i>atta</i> I was struck by
        the appropriateness of the analogy between the ritual act and the physiological
        event. Having taught natural childbirth classes for 15 years I was familiar with
        many teaching tools, metaphoric devices, women&#8217;s fantasies and visualization
        techniques used to enhance the pregnant woman&#8217;s understanding of the birth
        process. I was impressed by the simple elegance of the physiological analogy, the
        symbolic meaning. Only later did I come to appreciate the cultural resonance of
        the ritual substance, &#8216;<i>atta</i>,&#8217; within the life context of agrarian
        people.
    </p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        On one level we can understand the <i>atta</i> ritual on the visual and symbolic
        level. Doors, windows, locks, hair are opened so that this opening can be mirrored
        in the labouring woman&#8217;s body. Similarly one mound of <i>atta</i> is separated
        into two providing a sign and visual metaphor for the fetus separating from the
        mother&#8217;s body. But the meaning of the symbolic medium, <i>atta</i>, is enhanced
        within the context of agricultural people. In folk forms and Sanskrit texts women&#8217;s
        capacity to bear life and the earth&#8217;s fertility are imaged as imbued with
        the same generative power. <i>atta</i> as analogous to the female body is an accepted
        cultural representation which is particularized in this labour ritual. The <i>atta</i>
        ritual resonates with both physiologic and culturally specific meaning<sup><a href="#17"
            class="contentlinksbold">17</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        My understanding of <i>bemata</i> and birth rites has deepened through ongoing interactions
        with <i>dais</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Ten years later, in our first MATRIKA workshop with <i>dais</i> from Delhi slums
        we were told:</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        <i>bemata</i> is an old woman, has white hair and walks with the help of a stick.
        She stays under the earth and makes putle (puppets) and gives them to people. She
        gives to some people and does not give to others. When a baby smiles, it is believed
        that <i>bemata</i> is making her smile.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Imaged as a playful and rather fickle old woman, <i>bemata</i> is amazingly familiar
        and at the same time a divine persona. She is invoked at the time of childbirth
        being the special patron of <i>dais</i> and parturient women. Living underground,
        she creates human beings out of earth, breathing life into them and writes their
        fate on their foreheads shortly after birth. <i>bemata</i> is immanent in all nature,
        grows and protects the baby in the womb, but also se ems to be responsible for complications
        if she does not &#8216;exit&#8217; the mother&#8217;s body via postpartum bleeding.
        She is understood to leave the birth home at the time of the Chatti rite, six days
        after birth when she is thanked for growing and protecting the baby. However, she
        is also perceived as being responsible for diseases of mother and child in the postpartum
        period. Theologically, it is important to note that the presence of the same force
        that is seen as benign and fecund at one time (pregnancy and birth) becomes destructive
        and dangerous at another (post birth) if she is not in the process of diminishing
        or leaving. Thus the divine/demonic valence of <i>bemata</i> is entirely contextual
        and time-dependent.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        The <i>bemata</i> figure encodes a process orientation towards birth and postpartum
        while providing a framework for diagnostics and therapeutics. In obstetrical practice
        an examination done first one minute and then five minutes after birth, called &#8216;the
        Apgar score&#8217;, is used to assess the well being of the newborn. It is a scale
        for measuring the infant&#8217;s process of adapting to extra-uterine life. But
        no such formal, process-oriented assessment is geared towards the bodily functioning
        of the mother postpartum, the time the <i>dais</i> call &#8216;the closing of the
        body&#8217;. <i>bemata</i> operates as a diagnostic system assisting <i>dais</i>
        in their roles as caretakers of mothers, especially crucial in the six day post
        birth period.</p>
    <p class="lrgtxt2">
        She Who Knows: <i>bemata</i> Writes the Newborn&#8217;s Fate</p>
    <p class="default">
        <i>bemata</i> is often described as writing the destiny of the infant on the third
        day after the birth, so she signifies in the realm of cosmic knowing as well as
        physiological process. The power to inscribe an infant&#8217;s fate attributes to
        her the knowledge (and perhaps the enactment) of that fate. The attribution of such
        knowing to a <i>bemata</i>-like figure is not limited to <i>dais</i>. According
        to A.K. Ramanujan, sharply contrasting belief systems about causality are displayed
        in Brahminic texts and women&#8217;s folk tales. Both South Indian women&#8217;s
        folk tales and North Indian <i>dais</i>&#8217; statements reflect the view that
        life events are determined by fate, not karma.

        The story of the Lampstand Woman is told in the Kannada, Tamil and Telugu areas&#8230;.
        What happens to the heroine has nothing to do with her character. It is made clear
        that she is blameless. There is no villainy, no fault. Mother Fate seems a bit jealous
        of the woman&#8217;s good fortune&#8230;.but the storytellers (when I ask them)
        tell me it&#8217;s all because of &#8216;what&#8217;s written on the forehead,&#8217;
        or the will of Mother Fate (Vidhiyamma). Character is not destiny here, nor does
        the character have to &#8216;learn through suffering&#8217; as in Western (Greek
        or Shakespearean) drama.

    <p class="left-indent">
        Vidhi or Fate, is usually imagined as a woman, Vidhiyamma in South Kannada: Setivi
        Tayi in North Kannada and Marathi (Karve 1950). She writes on a newborn child&#8217;s
        forehead all that is going to happen to him or her. Sometimes the vidhi function
        is performed By Brahma<sup><a href="#18" class="contentlinksbold">18</a></sup>.

    <p class="default">
        An early Census Report from the undivided Punjab from 1883 also suggests that <i>bemata</i>

        In the outer room Vidhata (vulg.) Bidh Mata is worshipped, no men, not even a Brahman,

        offering to it the food cooked for the feast. Brahmins and relatives are fed, and
        the members of the household congratulated. The idol is kept for one and a quarter
        months and then deposited near the wall<sup><a href="#19" class="contentlinksbold">19</a></sup>.

        In the same document it is stated that &#8220;If, while asleep, the child smiles,

        is a Hindu goddess, who it is believed, makes the child smile at times, and at others

        One dai stated that <i>bemata</i> derives from <i>bahi-mata</i>&#8212;she who keeps
        accounts of the person&#8217;s life<br />
        Whatever the etymology of <i>bemata</i> may be, it is apparent that she is not a
        transcendent, aloof force, separate from human activity, material and embodied life.
        She is depicted as engaged, transient in her role as ethno-medical signifier, and
        capable of being invoked during childbirth.

    <p class="default">
        Most significant, from a gender perspective, she is a knower. For women at the time
        of birth this capacity for female knowing, particularly knowing the body, is essential.
        In the dominant Samkhya philosophy, with its Purusha-Prakrti paradigm, Purusha is
        rendered as the cosmic knower of the &#8216;field&#8217; of embodiment<sup><a href="#21"

        <span class="lrgtxt2">Understanding Body Imagery in Ritual Performance</span></p>
    <p class="default">
        <i>dais</i> and the mothers they serve perform birth rituals which early ethnographers
        have referred to as &#8216;imitative&#8217; or &#8216;sympathetic&#8217; magic.
        Today, they are dismissed by biomedical, public health and even women&#8217;s health
        programs as &#8216;superstition&#8217;. The opening rites (untying knots; opening
        locks, doors and windows; loosening hair; removing bangles) are common throughout
        India. Ritual opening is performed in the external world. This opening is then mimicked
        or mirrored in the inner world of the maternal body. The manipulation of the external
        environment serves as a permission and encouragement for the opening of the womb.
        The mother&#8217;s ritual separation of one mound of <i>atta</i> into two (with
        the support of the dai and invoking <i>bemata</i>), in the same way, imitates imaginatively
        the separation of the pregnant maternal body into two&#8212;mother and babe.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Our MATRIKA research shows how widespread and important these ritual facilitations
        of labour are for <i>dais</i> and other women who assist the birthing mothers. Our
        analysis has emphasized their congruence with female physiology and links with <i>bemata</i>
        as an empowering figure. For example, consider the following reports of &#8216;opening&#8217;
        and &#8216;splitting&#8217; imagery.</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        Delhi&#8212;&#8220;All knots on the woman's clothing, her hair, other knots or locks
        in the room are usually untied or opened.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        &#8220;Aata is kept in a thaali and cut in two before the birth. The <i>jacha</i>
        herself is asked to cut it with a coin. It speeds the birth, and symbolizes the
        cutting of the umbilical cord.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        Bihar&#8212;&#8220;<i>dais</i> facilitate birth by requesting that all knots, locks,
        boxes in the room to be opened.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        Rajasthan&#8212;&#8220;Maybe the pains are not coming because of some aanth (blockage)
        inside. Then to open that block we open all the knots. We take off woman's bindi,
        bangles, hair band, locks on boxes and windows. We say, &#8216;<i>bemata</i> open
        her knots the way we opened all knots.&#8217; We also give alms.&#8221;

        and grain is divided in two portions. With one portion halwa is made and <i>jacha</i>

        Some <i>dais</i> make a gobar image of <i>bemata</i> and when the woman takes off

        figure. During the birth time, then, the identities of the mother, the dai, and
        that of <i>bemata</i> are conflated&#8212;allowing the <i>jacha</i> or birthing

            (fruit)</span></p>
    <p class="default">
        The placenta is referred to, and revered as, &#8220;another mother&#8221; to the
        child. The placenta is the organ interfacing maternal and fetal systems, providing
        nutrients and oxygen to the fetus and transferring waste products back to the mother&#8217;s
        circulation system to be expelled. <i>dais</i> consider the placenta to be the flower
        and the baby, the fruit. Traditionally this afterbirth is buried, sometimes in the
        house or courtyard, with rite and prayer for the newborn child. How the placenta
        is treated is believed to affect the well being of the child. In one area it was
        said that if the newborn vomits then they tap the place where the placenta was buried.
        In another, infection of the navel was treated topically, and also dealt with by
        tamping down the earth at the burial site. In Tamil Nadu placentas hang in gunny
        sacks on trees which have milky sap&#8212;thought to promote lactation in the mother.
        All these ritual performances utilize the healing power of the human imagination
        within a knowledge system based on radically different epistomologies and ontologies
        than biomedical rationalism. Vital correlations between the human body and the earth
        body (microcosm-macrocosm) are assumed. Similar assumptions underlie Tantra, Yoga
        and Ayurvedic systems.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Maternal anatomy and physiology, i.e. the placenta and/or the umbilical cord, are
        appropriated for other purposes in dominant Hindu religious imagery and ritual.
        Note the image of Vishnu reclining on <em>Sheshnag</em> with the umbilical cord
        emanating up from his navel. At the top of the cord is an open lotus, which holds
        the deity Brahma. In some of these images <em>Lakshmi</em>, the female presence,
        is relegated to massaging Vishnu&#8217;s feet! Sanskritist and historian Sukumari
        Bhattacharji describes the utilization of maternal imagery in high caste initiation
        rituals of the sacred thread.</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        You may find new light on this in the Vedic ritual directives (mythologization of
        birth) on the <em>Upanayana</em> ceremony, the second birth. Mark the role of the
        initiating priest, the acarya in the <em>Upanayana</em>. A close analysis may lead
        to the sacred thread being a replica of the umbilical cord in reverse: the dai removes
        it, the <em>acarya</em> winds it on the ritually newborn<sup><a href="#23" class="contentlinksbold">23</a></sup>.

    <p>
        <span class="lrgtxt2">Cutting the Cord as a Great Paap (Sin)</span></p>
    <p class="default">
        One dai in Rajasthan informed us that the dai was considered &#8220;a ma, a <em>vaidya</em>,
        and a butcher.&#8221;
        <br />
        The &#8220;<em>ma</em>&#8221; is understandable as she supports, nurtures and &#8216;mothers&#8217;
        the mother. The &#8220;<em>vaidya</em>&#8221; is also comprehensible in terms of
        her ethno-medical role. The &#8220;butcher&#8221; is more problematic and complex
        and central to the concept of the &#8220;sin&#8221; of cutting the cord. Almost
        all <i>dais</i> wait until the placenta is out before tying and cutting the cord
        and when they speak in their idiom, they acknowledge it as a great <em>paap</em>,
        but one which they never express guilt, shame (<em>sharam</em>) or regret about.
        The <em>paap</em> would seem to derive more from their caste status as practitioners
        handling birth than the ethics of the act of cutting the cord<sup><a href="#24" class="contentlinksbold">24</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Another Rajasthani dai said the act of cutting the cord was considered a paap that
        equals the killing of a 100 cows. She explained that the cord has <i>jee van</i>(life).
        Other <i>dais</i> have mentioned that the umbilical cord has 72<em> nadis</em> or
        channels for life energy. <i>dais</i> usually offer something to the gods in connection
        with cutting the cord. Often her role extends to burying the placenta and cord and
        performing the rites which accompany that act. The <em>paap </em>of cord-cutting
        seems to be related to high caste attitudes towards the &#8216;down and dirty&#8217;
        birth work of <i>dais</i>. It is deeply paradoxical that these indigenous midwives,
        whose methods are so non-invasive and attuned to the life force, are disparaged
        as sinful for this act of helping women birth their babies. On the other hand, terming
        the cutting of the bond between mother and child <em>paap</em> also expresses the
        value of the mother-child bond and reverence for fleshy female blood ties. It appears
        that something alive, which possesses <i>jee van</i>, is being violated by being
        severed.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Indigenous midwives have the utmost respect for the parts of the female body usually
        considered as waste products by the biomedical system or highly polluting by the
        <em>Dharamshastras</em>. Not cutting the umbilical cord until the placenta is delivered
        is the common tradition throughout India, although <i>dais</i> are now being trained
        to cut it immediately according to the obstetrical model. . Traditional women consider
        the infant-cord-placenta as an integral package. Baby and placenta have been together
        for nine months with this organ functioning to nurture the fetus. Why should they
        be severed too quickly? Midwives throughout the country have been known to use the
        placenta to resuscitate the baby if it is not breathing. The placenta is heated,
        sometimes by placing it on the<em> tava</em>, and <i>jee</i>, or life force flows
        from the <em>phool</em> to the <em>phul</em>, reviving it. One dai said &#8220;In
        the city doctors have injections, machines and all, to take care of such babies,
        but we only have the placenta, so we use it.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="default">
        <span class="lrgtxt2"><i>jee</i> as Life Force or Vital Energy</span></p>
    <p class="default">
        <i>bemata</i> presides over the flow of the vital energy which nurtures and grows
        the embryo in utero.
        <br />
        <i>dais</i> use the word &#8216;<i>jee</i>&#8217; to describe the palpable pulsations
        which they are able to detect in the body generally, and the female pregnant body
        specifically. During the third or fourth week after conception, skilled practitioners
        are able to feel the splitting off of this life force energy to support the emerging
        life of the embryo, allowing them to detect pregnancy. The word &#8216;<i>jee</i>&#8217;
        is related to &#8216;<i>jee van</i>&#8217;, the Hindi word for life. Biomedicine
        has no equivalent to the notion of <i>jee</i>. Concepts similar to <i>jee</i> exist
        in other systems of medicine. Chi or ki in Chinese and Japanese medicine; vital
        force in homeopathy; prana in Ayurveda and pranic healing all signify life energy.
        Health modalities and therapeutic systems which are based on facilitating and augmenting
        <i>jee</i> mainly concern themselves with removing blockages to the life force and
        maintaining or restoring balance in the body.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        An early reference to the concept of <i>jee</i> or prana is found in the Atharvaveda
        and is stated in terms of the embryo:
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Man breathes out and breathes in when within the womb. When thou, O Prana, quickenest
        him, then he is born again.</p>
    <p class="default">
        They call <em>Prana Matarisvan</em> (that swells in the womb); <em>Prana</em>, forsooth,
        is called <em>Vata</em> (wind) the past and the future, the all, is supported upon
        Prana<sup><a href="#25" class="contentlinksbold">25</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Although not considered medical texts, the <em>Upanishads</em> provide similar mappings
        of bodily processes. The <em>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</em> states that the most
        subtle essence of food is distributed throughout the<em> nadis</em> to support the
        body. The Chhandogya <em>Upanishad</em> states that 101 <em>nadis</em> proceed from
        the heart. The<em> Mandukya </em>states that like spokes in a wheel, <em>nadis</em>
        are connected to the heart. The navel, the root of the connection to the mother,
        is viewed as the seat of Prana and the source of all the nadis.
    </p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        The navel is the origin of all the vessels, and the principal seat of the life (pran),
        as it is situated there in larger quantities than elsewhere. The navel may be said
        to resemble the root of a water lily, from which the different vessels proceed to
        all parts of the body<sup><a href="#26" class="contentlinksbold">26</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        According to scholarly works on Ayurveda by Filliozat, Vaidyas Bhagwan Dash and
        Lalitesh Kashyap, a similar concept of vital forces is termed &#8220;<em>ojas</em>&#8221;<sup><a
            href="#27" class="contentlinksbold">27</a></sup>.<sup></sup></p>
    <p class="default">
        Traditional midwives in many parts of the world have considered a birth occurring
        in the eighth month of pregnancy as particularly dangerous for the child. And Dash
        and Kasyap quote the <em>Susruta</em> <em>Samhita</em> which states &#8220; During
        the eighth month of pregnancy, there is instability in the ojas. If there is a delivery
        during this period, the child does not survive because of the absence of<em> ojas</em>
        in it&#8230;&#8221;<sup><a href="#28" class="contentlinksbold">28</a></sup> <sup></sup>
        This Ayurvedic knowledge is a part of indigenous midwifery, but totally absent from
        obstetrics. Interestingly, older midwives in the United States (termed granny midwives)
        also had this belief/knowledge about the dangers of the eighth month, but it has
        long been considered an &#8216;old wives tale.&#8217;
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Free flow of <i>jee</i> through the body maintains health. Obstructions or imbalances
        cause pathology. Removing blockages in the vessels or channels (<em>nadis</em>),
        conduits for <i>jee</i>, is one of the functions of Indian forms of massage. Whereas
        western massage therapies use strokes promoting venous return (up the arms and legs,
        towards the heart), Indian massage techniques involve moving negative energies or
        blocks down the limbs and out of the body. The underlying concept of bodily functioning
        is radically different. Maintaining or restoring balance in the body is conceptualized
        as working on the following axes: hot and cold; up and down; open and closed, etc.
        Restoring balance of the<em> panch mahabhuta</em> (five elements), earth, air, fire,
        water and space, is also part of indigenous therapeutic work of promoting <i>jee</i>.

        &#8216;Tradition&#8217; is not static and unchanging, the dynamic folk forms of
        common people are flexible and able to address current issues in a &#8216;mythic&#8217;
        idiom. A.K. Ramanujan reminds us that texts are new issues of old citations. &#8220;Bits
        of codes, formulae, rhythmic models, fragments of social languages pass into the

        oral, folk traditions allow for the absorption of new material and yet allow for
        the &#8216;sub-culture&#8217;s&#8217; perspective and values to be maintained. The
        following <i>bemata</i> stories from Maharashtra illustrate this point aptly<sup><a
            href="#30" class="contentlinksbold">30</a></sup>.</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        Some people were walking through the forest and an old woman, <i>bemata</i> or Dharti
        Ma, was spotted perched in a tree. She was groaning and crying. The people, seeing
        that she was in pain, called her down from the tree, that she might be more comfortable.
        The old woman came down, lay down and revealed her charred abdomen. She said, &#8220;See
        what chemical fertilizers and pesticides have done to me!&#8221;</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        An old woman was sitting next to a boulder weeping, distraught. People approached
        her and ask about what is bothering her. She pushed the boulder aside and under
        were lots of tiny, tiny children. The old woman said, &#8220;Family planning people
        are doing so many abortions&#8212;all these children have not been able to be born
        because of this.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="default">
        Dissatisfaction with the effects of modern agriculture and population policies are
        encoded and expressed via a <i>bemata</i> &#8216;theology&#8217;, a personification
        of life force that has been violated and transgressed. The sacrality of the life
        force or <i>jee</i> is often a religious tenet of indigenous peoples. This means
        that coercive family planning policies are an anathema to them. Sensitivity to,
        and respect for notions of the life force can be distinguished from the patriarchal
        attitudes valorizing women for their fertility and making motherhood compulsory
        for women. Respect for the capacity of the female body for reproduction (as well
        as honoring the blood of menstruation and childbirth) should accompany birth control
        policies and programs, rather than the hierarchical and ruthlessly anti-woman population
        control efforts.

    <p class="default">
        <span class="lrgtxt2">Textual References to <em>Narak </em>in the Puranas</span></p>
    <p class="default">
        Both <i>dais</i> and Puranic texts share the language of narak. However, the perceptions,
        values and significance attributed to the concept is radically different. As we
        consider the meanings of narak in the Puranic literature, we must also keep in mind
        the <i>dais</i>&#8217; roles as the ritual specialists and ethno-medical practitioners
        who have the capacity to &#8220;negotiate narak&#8221; and literally handle the
        bodily power of the female body at the time of parturition<sup><a href="#31" class="contentlinksbold">31</a></sup>.
        The enterprise of drawing from diverse local traditions in order to consolidate
        and propagate Brahminic world view and religio-cultural norms involved defining,
        containing and delimiting the reproductive power of the female body, women who were
        knowledgeable about that power and the birth event itself. Brahminism, in its valorization
        of the transcendent, devalued, desacralized and even demonized (rendered hellish)
        the bodily female power of birth. Caste and gender hierarchies are intrinsic in
        this devaluation.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The ideological components of &#8216;myth&#8217; must be considered while unpacking
        the significance of narak or the demonic in textual traditions<sup><a href="#32"
            class="contentlinksbold">32</a></sup>. Velcheru Narayana Rao foregrounds this
        ideological function of the texts in his investigation of the five<em> laksanas</em>
        or distinguishing marks of Puranic literature.
    </p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        I would like to suggest&#8230;that <em>pancalaksana</em> is the ideological frame
        that transforms whatever content is incorporated into that frame. Since ideas of
        <em>pancalaksana</em> are tacitly assumed in the Brahminic worldview, they do not
        even appear in every Purana and do not constitute a sizeable length of the text
        when they appear.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Furthermore Rao historicizes the evolution of Puranic material when examining its
        ideological dimensions.
    </p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        All civilizations make their own past to make sense of the present, to control the
        present. When a new power emerges, the first thing it does is to reject the old
        past and to create a new one in its place. This is done not just by altering the
        &#8220;facts&#8221; of the past, but by creating a new way of perceiving the &#8220;facts&#8221;.
        An extreme instance of creating a new way of perceiving facts is evidenced when
        the very concepts of time and space in which events take place are changed<sup><a
            href="#33" class="contentlinksbold">33</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        According to A.K. Ramanujan, both folk and Sanskritic Puranas functioned to imbue
        mundane life experiences with mythic significance.
    </p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        Such stories connect a daily perception with a mythic incident&#8212;as the Sansrkitic
        Puranas themselves do very often. Such etiological myths that explain why something
        is what it is&#8212;why dogs copulate in public and get teased for it, why cats
        hide their faeces, why the chipmunk has three stripes, why the sky is so high (all
        because of mythic events)&#8212;give us a pervasive mythology of ordinary life<sup><a
            href="#34" class="contentlinksbold">34</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        This deeply ideological mythology of ordinary life, as Rao notes, manipulates the
        concepts of time and space. The timeless aspect of Puranic material is accomplished,
        in part, by narrative device. The authority and legitimacy of the tale derives from
        obscured narrative voice.
    </p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        Then there are different speakers of the Puranas for different listeners. Each Purana
        has a specific speaker. However, it is important to note that no speaker ever directly
        narrates. All the Purana narratives are reported narratives. Each speaker has an
        earlier speaker. Each listener has an earlier listener. They look inward and backward
        drawing us into an ideologically closed environment. But if the Puranas are ideologically
        closed texts, they are functionally open texts: they have accepted into their fold
        events, stories, legends, and occurrences of many regions and communities, transforming
        them to confirm to a fixed ideology<sup><a href="#35" class="contentlinksbold">35</a></sup>
        .
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Whereas the <i>dais</i> are clear that narak signifies the lower part of the body
        and that <i>bemata</i> dwells beneath the earth, producing both babies and vegetation,
        the Puranas locate narak as a moral (read ideological) space which is not geographically
        sited. Cornelia Dimmitt and J.A.B. van Buitenen describe the Puranic rendering of
        space, or Hindu pre-modern geography, in terms of seven concentric spheres, divisions
        of the original cosmic egg<sup><a href="#36" class="contentlinksbold">36</a></sup>.</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        There are seven successively higher heavens (lokas), realms of the gods and immortal
        beings, and seven successively lower netherworlds (patalas) where demons and chthonic
        beings dwell. In the middle lies earth on which human beings live. This symmetrical
        picture is somewhat complicated by the fact that there are also a number of hells
        (narakas) which are found in a downward direction of no clear spatial location.
        That the hells are different from the netherworlds is clear, for the hells, which
        to begin with number more than seven, are the locations of gruesome punishments
        for human sinners, whereas the netherworlds are described in glowing terms with
        the demons inhabiting most pleasant houses and gardens<sup><a href="#37" class="contentlinksbold">37</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        Their [the hells] purpose is to provide retribution for social transgressions; they
        are the domains of Yama, the god of death, whose servants carry out the various
        forms of punishment&#8230;.these texts primarily describe the hells where human
        beings go after death, reaping the ill effects of their evil acts on earth. They
        are a moral rather than a physical space<sup><a href="#38" class="contentlinksbold">38</a></sup>&#8230;.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        The nature of punishments visited on the transgressors reflect a concern for bodily
        purity and integrity, for to violate the body results in the worst punishments.
        The authors state that the function of this vision of narak would be a social one:
        that the fear of reprisal would compel the living to avoid the sins as depicted
        out of fear of eventual punishment.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        I am suggesting a relationship between these graphically depicted punishments and
        the fact that cutting of the umbilical cord is considered to be a great paap or
        sin. <i>dais</i>, of course did not, and do not avoid their work with the bodies
        of parturient women. Neither do they avoid the handling of bodily substances considered
        polluting by the &#8216;twice born&#8217; nor the act of cutting (violating?) the
        umbilical cord. And indeed they do suffer the consequences of their religio-cultural
        and ethno-medical handling of birth&#8212;they are deemed to have committed great
        paap and are &#8216;untouchable&#8217;<sup><a href="#39" class="contentlinksbold">39</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Transgressions listed in the Puranas result in vividly described tortures of two
        types: those that abuse the body by external means (such as burning vats, pincers,
        razor sharp leaves, the flaying of skin and having intestines pulled out by the
        sharp beaks of birds). Those that cause internal pollution include:</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        This sort of punishment requires the wicked to eat a variety of dreadful things:
        dogs, wolves, scorpions, pus, feces and urine<sup><a href="#40" class="contentlinksbold">40</a></sup>.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Actual practices of <i>dais</i> and indigenous peoples are the same as hellish experiences.
        The mention of pus, feces and urine can be related to various Indian spiritual,
        health and healing traditions which advocate the ingesting of bodily substances
        for medicinal and spiritual purposes. Urine therapy is perhaps the most well known.
        Tantriks have been known to consume urine and feces, as well as menstrual blood.
        Many indigenous peoples have eaten insects of various kinds. I heard one Tai Chi
        master speak of the ancient custom of ingesting of the sweat of a teacher taken
        from his body and rolled into little balls after his physical practice, likewise
        excretions from high Tibetan lamas have been prized for their medicinal value. <i>dais</i>,
        particularly in Rajasthan, mention medicinal use of bodily substances. The baby
        is made to lick a part of the placenta to protect against respiratory diseases.
        In many areas a bit of the cord or the placenta may be consumed by a barren woman
        in order to conceive.</p>
    <p class="default">
        In the Vishnu <em>Purana</em>, naraka is reserved for &#8220;&#8230;those who neglect
        their duties, revile the Vedas, and obstruct religious rites&#8212;the places assigned
        after death are the terrific regions of darkness, of deep gloom, of fear and of
        great terror: the fearful hell of sharp swords, the hell of scourges and a waveless
        sea<sup><a href="#41" class="contentlinksbold">41</a></sup>.&#8221; This seems an
        obvious reference to punishment for religio-cultural behavior that is in conflict
        with the Vedic beliefs and norms of the authors of the text. Similar indications
        are found throughout Puranic literature. The Vishnu Purana also refers to an anthropomorphized
        Narak who is described as &#8220;The son of the earth, called<em> Naraka</em>, who
        rules over the city of <em>Pragjyotisha</em>, inflicts a great injury upon all creatures<sup><a
            href="#42" class="contentlinksbold">42</a></sup>.&#8221;<sup><a href="#42"> </a></sup>
        Pragjyotisha refers to Kamarupa or Kamakhya in Assam, where the Devi is worshiped
        during her menstrual period, the rainy season, and <i>prashad</i> is distributed
        in the form of cloth soaked in the red river water&#8212;symbolizing the menstrual
        blood of the Goddess. These tantric or shaktic religious forms hold female physiological
        process as sacred and are consequently defined, in Puranic hegemonic ideology as
        &#8216;injurious to all creatures&#8217;.</p>

        Textual References to Birth in the Puranas</p>
    <p class="default">
        Not surprisingly Puranic references to childbirth are replete with threatening demonesses
        rather than the bi-polar <i>bemata</i> and Shitala images detailed above. S.A. Dange
        describes the malevolent female powers which threaten women and young children.
        A central belief is elaborated that childbearing women and infants are tasty food
        for ghosts. Risks concerning a distraught mother and leaving a laboring woman alone
        are described.</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        According to the Varaha Puran (96.40) the multitude of evil female-powers produced
        by Camunda, the power of Rudra-Siva, asked for food as soon as they were created.
        Camunda allowed them various types of persons as food; among them are women in delivery
        and newborn babes...Some of these cruel ones take their victims from the delivery
        rooms, entering by holes and crevices. Some others may take away the new babes;
        and apart from delivery rooms, these powers possess pregnant women who weep alone
        and are forlorn at such places as their own home, at a religious place, at a tank
        or in a garden. According to the Skanda Puran (VI 88.43-51), if women with foetus
        sleep at the evening twilights, their foetus will be <i>atta</i>cked by these evil
        female powers, (the matrs who are said to have defeated the Yavanas and asked the
        goddess Ambavrddha for food as a reward.) Pregnant women who stand alone at the
        cross-roads or where three roads meet shall see their foetus taken away by evil
        powers....Similar beliefs are also recorded in the Markandeya Puran (51.105-107).
        It mentions the evil power Jataharini (&#8220;the usurper of the newborn&#8221;);
        she is described as terrible and human flesh-eater. She frequents delivery rooms
        that are devoid of fire and water, and which are not properly incensed, which have
        no lamp, weapon, pestle, ashes and mustard seed&#8230;. The Brahmanda Puran (I.
        2.27.114) says that to guard the delivery room from evil powers, ashes should be
        placed in it. Ashes</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        Are regarded as the semen of Shiva <sup><a href="#44" class="contentlinksbold">44</a></sup></p>
    <p class="default">
        Dange points out that in the Varaha Puran the demonic female powers emanating from
        Camunda want food and are given delivering women and newborns. In the realm of myth
        and ritual, &#8220;food&#8221; is not simply what people eat at mealtime; it signifies
        ritual offerings made to the gods and the ancestors. &#8220;Food,&#8221; especially
        infants and parturient women as tasty, sweet-smelling food for malevolent female
        powers, should be interpreted, at least partially, as relating to cultic tensions
        between belief systems and theologies. The primacy of, and ritual obligations to
        a masculine deity is in conflict with worship of the goddess&#8212;and this conflict
        would be exaggerated at the time of childbirth. Not surprisingly, as Rocher contends,
        &#8220;the two deities that dominate Puranic literature are, without doubt, <em>Visnu</em>
        and <em>Siva</em><sup><a href="#45" class="contentlinksbold">45</a></sup>.&#8221;
        The &#8220;Great Purana&#8221; tradition, in fact, seems largely to overlook the
        Great Goddess, however much, it may have been influenced by<em> Sakta</em> ideas
        in its later phases<sup><a href="#46" class="contentlinksbold">46</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        In the cases of <em>Sitala </em>and <i>bemata</i>, the &#8220;demonic&#8221; cannot
        be separated from the &#8220;divine&#8221; feminine power&#8212;they exist simultaneously
        and are entirely contingent on context and time. This simultaneity is a mark of
        ethno-medical understanding and <i>dais</i>&#8217; religio-cultural praxis. It is
        the mythic context, the stories relating sources of power and the gender of divinities,
        which imbue meaning to ritual performances. The goddess responsible for birth and
        death, disease and cure when Sanskritised was transformed from a multi-facetted
        feminine divine to a threatening and malevolent female demonic pantheon. Note also
        the shift in the figure of <em>Hariti </em>at the time of her conversion by the
        <em>Buddha</em>. Legend describes her as the stealer of children, a child eating
        demoness<sup><a href="#47" class="contentlinksbold">47</a></sup>. However, she was&#8212;and
        still is, in the folk imagination&#8212;a similar bi-polar and multi-facetted image
        of the devi/demoness who causes, protects from and cures disease.</p>

        <span class="lrgtxt2">Textual References to Birth in Susruta Samhita</span></p>
    <p class="default">
        References to demonic female spirits consuming infants are also found in Ayurvedic
        medical texts. In the <em>Susruta Samhita</em> causal linkages are forged between
        the ritual performance of the caregivers, diagnostic categories, and disease. In
        the <em>Uttaram Tantra</em> the origins, causes, symptoms and treatment of &#8220;the
        nine diseases of infant life&#8221; are represented in characterizations of the
        demonic feminine.</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        These malignant stars (<em>Graha</em>) or demons affect the person of a child in
        the cases where the directions laid down before (in the <em>Sarira-sthana</em>)
        in respect of the conduct of the mother or the nurse during the time the child is
        brought up on the breast are not followed, and consequently where proper benedictory
        rites are not performed and the child is allowed to remain in an uncleanly state,
        or where the child becoming anyhow uneasy gets frightened, is rebuked, or begins
        to cry. They (demons) make their appearance for the purpose of getting proper respect
        and worship<sup><a href="#48" class="contentlinksbold">48</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Improper maternal care of the infant and lack of ritual observance are the occasions
        for demonic influences. The text proceeds to list the symptoms related to each of
        the demons. Then the demon/deities are identified as creations of the gods and goddesses
        specifically made up from the menstrual fluid (&#8220;<em>Rajasa</em> essence&#8221;)
        of the goddesses <em>Ganga</em>, <em>Uma</em> and <em>Krittika</em>!</p>
    <p class="left-indent">
        The nine presiding deities- viz., <em>Skanda</em> and others-of the nine diseases
        of infant life are all possessed of ethereal frames, divine effulgence and specific
        sex-distinction of their own. They were created by the gods <em>Agni</em>, <em>Mahadeva
        </em>and the goddesses<em> Krittika </em>and <em>Uma</em> for guarding the person
        of the new born Guha though protecting himself with his own divine prowess amidst
        the stems of S&#8217;ara grass. Of these Grahas the females who are possessed of
        various shapes as described before are considered as originally made of the Rajasa
        essence of the goddesses <em>Ganga</em>,<em> Uma</em> and <em>Krittika</em><sup><a
            href="#49" class="contentlinksbold">49</a></sup>.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The fact that these female demons are characterized as originating in the menstrual
        essence of Ganga, Uma and Krittika suggests that the authors of the Sushruta Samhita
        are reworking a pre-existing meaning system which may have used menstrual fluid
        ritually, medicinally or both. At the very least this fluid would have been imaged
        in an entirely different manner than in this text. It is also possible that this
        text reflects diagnostic categories involving the <em>gunas</em> or properties,
        powers of menstrual fluid which influence health during parturition.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Within the Susruta Samhita, demons of disease are represented as resulting from
        violations of Brahminic ritual norms and prescribed childcare. They are also invoked
        by the authors to prey upon the children of caregivers who do not follow proper
        procedure. In the following passage the demons are addressed in the second person,
        &#8220;you&#8221; and &#8220;your&#8221;, and advised that they will receive their
        oblations because of the fear of these diseases. As noted above, the speaker is
        obscured by narrative device.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Children of the families in which the gods, the <em>Pitrs</em> (departed fathers),
        the <em>Brahmans</em>, the pious, the preceptors and the seniors and the guests
        are not properly worshipped and attended upon and wherein the rules of cleanliness
        and virtues are not observed and the members of which do not make <em>daily</em>
        offering to the gods and give alms to beggars...would be the proper persons whom<strong>
            you </strong>might strike with impunity, and <strong>by your malign influence lay them
                up with diseases</strong> peculiar to infant life. (It shall be your duty
        to see that iniquities of the parents are visited on their children. <strong>attack
            them without least compunction of heart and ample means of subsistence will be thereby
            secured to you</strong>). There the parents of those children will worship you
        in their calamities and <strong>you</strong> shall get plenty to live upon<sup><a
            href="#50" class="contentlinksbold">50</a></sup>. (emphasis mine)</p>
    <p class="default">
        It appears that a holistic theology and ethno-medical application of the goddess
        (in which she is understood to both cause and cure disease) is fractured in this
        Ayurvedic text into advice to follow ritual and childcare norms&#8212;or else be
        cursed by these demons. Violations are to be &#8220;punished&#8221; by the shadow
        or dangerous side of the powerful feminine divine, now imaged as only demonic and
        malevolent&#8212;split off as she is from her diagnostic and healing functions.</p>
    <p class="default">
        <strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong><br />
        <strong>Theology, Ideology and Gender
            <br />
        </strong><em>Cultures do not simply constitute webs of significance, systems of meaning
            that orient humans to one another and their world. They constitute ideologies, disguising
            human political and economic realities&#8230;.Cultures are webs of mystification
            as well as significance. Theories of illness representations as mystification, in
            particular as mystifications of underlying social relations or relations of power,
            often draw on two sources: Gramsci&#8217;s analysis of hegemony, and Foucault&#8217;s
            &#8220;genealogy&#8221; of power...A critical medical anthropology forcefully poses
            the question of when illness representations are actually misrepresentations which
            serve the interests of those in power, be they colonial powers, elites within a
            society, dominant economic arrangements, the medical profession or empowered men<sup><a
                href="#51" class="contentlinksbold">51</a></sup>. </em>
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        The deity/demoness figure of <i>bemata</i> and her embodied realm of narak must
        be read as both mystification and ethno-medical signifier in order to effectively
        communicate with <i>dais</i> and the childbearing women whom they serve in order
        to be able to, as Kalpana Ram states, &#8220;apprehend the voices of women who situate
        their experience within a religious framework.&#8221; This paper has attempted to
        unpack <i>dais</i>&#8217; use of the word narak describing &#8220; the open female
        body&#8221; at the time of menstruation and childbirth&#8212;from both the <i>dais</i>&#8217;
        perspective and that of the dominant textual traditions. Likewise caste and gender
        are deeply implicated in notions of a great <em>paap</em>, that of killing 100 cows,
        being committed in the act of cutting the umbilical cord.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Finally <i>bemata</i> is friend to <i>dais</i>&#8212;she is like they are, in that
        she produces babies and <i>dais</i> catch babies. They are both nurturing and life-affirming
        in their roles, but not in conflict with death, disease, misfortune or &#8216;complications&#8217;.
        Narak is the earthy field from which all life is generated, not a battlefield requiring
        the actions of the heroic masculine<sup><a href="#52" class="contentlinksbold">52</a></sup>.
        <i>bemata</i> and <i>dais</i> both accept death as intrinsic to life. Death, being
        a part of life, does not require conflict, battle or heroism, as in modern allopathic
        medicine. The deity works alongside the <i>dais</i>&#8212;empowering them and allowing
        them to be responsive to the life force as they sense it. Indeed experienced <i>dais</i>
        exude tremendous embodied confidence and devotion.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Narak, as the unseen source of life and site of birth and death, provides a field
        for indigenous cultural reasoning to play. But this play is not simply fantasies
        of the imagination. It is an empirically grounded mapping of female physiological
        processes. And it is this mapping which allows for the sophisticated indigenous
        reasoning system of diagnostics and therapeutics, as shown above. Narak provides
        space for intuition, imagination, other epistemologies and other therapies. Female
        embodiment is known and respected. Dignity is bestowed on human qualities: the need
        for affectionate touch; processing and expressing emotion; the reality of physical
        sensation. Conceptual categorization does not dominate and attempt to control female
        physiological processes. Narak and <i>bemata</i> can hold both ethno-medical knowledge
        and the mysteries inherent in the birth process.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The problem with classical religious teachings is that woman is de-sacralized at
        the height of her bodily powers. This, I would posit, is gender ideology. Furthermore,
        on the Indian subcontinent, the many representations of the demonic feminine or
        &#8216;malignant female spirits&#8217; preying on new mothers and infants appear
        to relate to a conflict of belief and ritual systems. It is accepted that the Puranas
        were Brahminic narratives, told in the masculine voice, which served to consolidate
        and propagate the high caste worldview. This view was deeply suspicious of female
        power exercised outside of normative roles of wife and mother within patrilineal
        societies.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Anyone acquainted with Hindu society, with its hierarchy and differences in status,
        religious oppositions, and divisions of caste, knows that it presents an intense
        scene of conflicts and tensions. At the same time the dominant ideology of the society
        presents a homogeneous view of a well-ordered society. But despite the best efforts
        of the dominant ideology to present a homogeneous picture, we can still detect the
        ideological tensions both within the texts and outside the texts<sup><a href="#53"
            class="contentlinksbold">53</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Indeed I have encountered <i>bemata</i> outside text and icon, though years of crossing
        boundaries and listening carefully to the words of indigenous midwives who continue
        to serve the poorest of the poor. And I feel blessed to have received her darshan.</p>

                on the subcontinent have observed such observances of ritual pollution. Muslim,

                Das has unpacked the power relations inherent in notions of karma which hold the
                individual responsible for his or her suffering. </em>

        <p class="smltxt2" style="margin-left: 20px">
            <em>Cosmologies of the powerless hold the capriciousness of the gods and the sheer contingency
                of events responsible for the disorder of their lives. This, at the very least,
                has the potential of freeing those who suffer from having to take personal responsibility
                for their fate&#8230;But the in the cosmologies of the powerful, conversely, there
                is no place for chaos. For, if the contingent and chaotic nature of the world were
                acknowledged in these, it would have the potential to dismantle the structures of
                legitimacy through which suffering is imposed upon the powerless. Clothed in the
                language of responsibility, the discourse of power ends up with the equation that
                pain is equal to punishment and that the injustice of life, testified to by suffering,
                can only be redeemed by further suffering.</em></p>

            <em><span class="smltxt2"><sup><a name="24" id="24">24</a></sup>There is considerable
                evidence to suggest that Indian indigenous systems of medicine were had their origins
                from tribal and &#8216;outcaste&#8217; peoples. For example O.P.Jaggi, Ayurveda:
                Indian System of Medicine, (Atma Ram and Sons, Delhi, 1981) gives evidence in support
                of this assertion by noting that in the Mahabharata, the Asura priest, but not the
                Devata&#8217;s, knew the fine art of sanjivani. &#8220;Mention is made of cases
                of infusing life into the dead (sanjivani) in the Mahabharata. During the battle
                between the Gods and the Asuras, the two sides chose their family priests (purohitas)
                Brihaspati and Sukracharya respectively, to heal the injured and the dead. Sukracharya
                was well-versed in sanjevani. As such, the moment the Gods killed an Asura, Sukracharya
                would bring him back to life. Brihaspati did not know this fine art&#8230;.&#8221;p

        <p class="smltxt2" style="margin-left: 20px">
            <em>Such is the anomalous position of women. A demonic and promiscuous nature is ascribed
                as their lot due to the karma that produces a female birth; yet they must suppress
                it all in favour of their function as wives. But whereas the (ordinary) demon or
                apsaras is faced with an ethical conflict&#8212;ordained evil (i.e. svadharma, including
                svabhava) versus aspiration to goodness (sanatanadharma)--women are caught in a
                trap caused entirely by karma. Their position is more akin to that of the halfbreed
                demon priest....For both Visvarupa...and Vrtra..., a demonic svabhava (their maternal
                heritage) is in direct opposition to the svadharma of brahmin priest (their paternal
                heritage). Quite apart from the fact that such unions are in accordance with the
                principles of anuloma marriage...,it is no surprise&#8212;in view of the orthodox
                attitude towards women&#8212;to find that in each case the demon priest is born
                of a demon mother and a brahmin father: inheriting demonic qualities from one&#8217;s
                mother fits. This pattern is reinforced by the widespread notion that a child&#8217;s
                heart is born of its mother. Conflict is inevitable; both Visvarupa and Vrtra are
                doomed. No wonder that Sri, goddess of fortune and model for the Hindu wife remarks
                that no one knows if she is demonic or divine and she is called &#8216;intolerable&#8217;....
                Theoretically at least, her position is indeed intolerable. p 266.</em></p>

                have raged since 1902 (with Vincent Smith&#8217;s corroboration that the genealogies
                and duration of the reigns of Andhra kings preserved in the Matsya Purana was basically
                correct) about the extent of the historicity of the Puranas. Ludo Rocher notes that
                Puranic time is cyclical, without beginning or end: its structure is one of a series
                of cycles, yugas. He also points out that an important aspect of Puranic cosmogonic
                myths is their congruence with Samkhya philosophical concepts. However unlike Dimmitt
                and van Buitenen above, Rocher identifies the Puranic lokas as a series of vertically
                arranged parallel planes. See Ludo Rocher, &#8216;The Puranas&#8217; in Jan Gonda&#8217;s
                A History of Indian Literature, Vol. III (Otto Harrossowitz, Weisbaden, 1986) Velcheru
                Narayana Rao, however, notes that Puranic time deteriorates, that each age or yuga
                is inferior to the previous one until the final dissolution completes the cycle
                and starts a new one. This downward spiral seems to be the popularized Hindu version.
