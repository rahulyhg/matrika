    <h2>
        RECOGNITION OF INDIGENOUS COGNITIVE PROCESSES:<br />
        PLACENTA, LIFE FORCE AND &#8216;SIN&#8217; IN DAIS MIDWIFERY PRACTICE</h2>
    <span class="caption">Paper presented at the 100th meeting of the American Anthropological
        Association in Washington, DC, USA 2001</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    The ethnographic data contained in this paper is drawn from three years of research
    by MATRIKA, (Motherhood and Traditional Resources, Information, Knowledge and Action)&#8212;an
    NGO effort to document, interpret and analyze traditional midwives&#8217; ethno-medical
    and religio-cultural traditions. The MATRIKA team interacted with dais (indigenous
    midwives) at workshops held in Rajasthan, Bihar, Punjab and slums on the outskirts
    of Delhi. Invaluable assistance in this research project was provided by local NGOs,
    particularly their health workers who were themselves from the communities and had
    longstanding relationships with the dais. The film excerpt from &#8220;Born at Home&#8221;,
    which you have seen, was shot in Rajasthan.
    <br />
    <br />
    At first <em>dais</em> seemed to want to impress us with their knowledge of the
    modern, biomedical approach to birth. But especially after our own enactments of
    the loneliness and confusion of a woman laboring in a hospital, they were convinced
    of our critical views on modern birth and began to trust and share what they really
    believed and practiced. Ours was a collective effort, a group of researcher-activists
    interacting with a group of<em> dais</em>. We ate, slept, talked, sang and danced,
    produced drawings and plays together. Our workshop activities were a celebration
    of the fertile capacity of female body and dais&#8217; cultural handling of birth.
    Our celebrating, however, was often under most difficult local conditions. Poverty,
    environmental degradation, violence and extremes of weather challenged our middle
    class urban sensibilities
    <br />
    <br />
    MATRIKA data consists of voluminous workshop transcripts; interviews; documentation
    of role plays depicting the handling of birth and accompanying rites; ritual drawings;
    birth songs; and team reports and analyses. MATRIKA reversed the common TBA training
    model by asking groups of dais to &#8216;train us&#8217; and to answer the question
    &#8216;what does a woman need during pregnancy, labour and postpartum?&#8217; We
    now have a more informed view of traditional mappings of female bodily processes
    and the religio-cultural contexts of this body knowledge. We have also documented
    dais&#8217; voices on their own experiences and perceptions: how they learned their
    skills; blessings and protection of deities; caste and occupation-based discrimination;
    living within impoverished communities; the increasing medicalization of birth;
    and how a degraded environment and modern agricultural methods compromise their
    communities&#8217; health.
    <br />
    <br />
    We were able to access and remain with this alien (to us) information because we
    decided at the outset that we must not execute the usual approach of limiting ourselves
    to modern categories of health and medicine. We were open to hearing about ritual
    practice, deities and demons, <em>bhut-pret</em> (ghosts and spirits), and the <em>nazar</em>
    or evil eye. In other words, we attempted to let the data speak the categories rather
    than the categories shape the data. MATRIKA&#8217;s findings demonstrate that dais
    do not observe the modern and mutually exclusive categories of religion and medicine.
    <br />
    <br />
    Now, acting as advocates for dais, we face the epistemologically challenging task
    of amplifying the voices and body knowledge systems of women who relate the heartfelt
    realities of their lives in a &#8216;religious&#8217; idiom. And this exercise is
    particularly perplexing when dealing with public health and biomedical establishments
    founded on the modernist assumptions that religion and medicine are mutually exclusive
    enterprises. Global Safe Motherhood and gender projects are influenced by neither
    pre-modern, nor postmodern ideas of body/spirit holism.
    <br />
    <br />
    Recognition of indigenous cognitive processes has, for us, involved crossing boundaries
    and listening carefully&#8212;to the unspoken as well as words. We learned that
    although the <em>dais</em> use some of the language of caste Hindu (and Sikh, Muslim
    and Christian) orthodoxy, denoting the defiling nature of birth, older <em>dais</em>
    maintain a healthy distance and ironic disdain for attitudes which demean their
    work. Rukhma Dadi laughs in the film as she relates that it is said that she has
    &#8216;sinned&#8217; by cutting so many umbilical cords. Her sardonic chuckle demonstrates
    an embodied confidence and ironic distance from such pejorative attitudes. Inheritors
    of the<em> dai</em> tradition see themselves primarily as servants of the life force,
    or<em> jee</em>. And the placenta is viewed as the repository of<em> jee</em>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
        Placenta as &#8216;<em>phool</em>&#8217; (flower), Newborn as &#8216;<em>phul</em>&#8217;
        (fruit)
    </h3>
    The placenta, the organ interfacing maternal and foetal systems, is referred to,
    and revered as, &#8220;another mother&#8221; to the child. One <em>dai</em> said
    &#8220;We never throw the placenta away. The child is so dear to us, so is the placenta
    dear to us. For nine months it has protected and supported the baby, so how can
    we throw it away?&#8221;<em> Dais</em> consider the placenta to be the flower and
    the baby, the fruit. As you have seen, the afterbirth is buried, in the house or
    courtyard, with rite and prayer for the newborn child. How the placenta is treated
    is believed to affect the well being of the child. Rituals honouring the placenta
    assume vital correlations between the human body and the earth body (microcosm-macrocosm)
    and allow for a system of knowledge and praxis based on radically different epistemologies
    and ontologies than biomedical rationalism. Similar assumptions exist in other Indian
    systems such as Tantra, Yoga and Ayurveda. But the dai tradition is not text-based.
    It is usually passed down through family based apprenticeship, mostly from mother-in-law
    to daughter-in-law&#8212;because a woman must have herself had the experience of
    childbearing before she is considered a creditable inheritor of the tradition.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
        <em>Jee</em> as Life Force or Vital Energy</h3>
    The placenta is viewed as the site of jee and as the protector or that which safeguards
    the fetus/baby. <em>Dais</em> use the word &#8216;<em>jee</em>&#8217; to describe
    the palpable pulsations which they are able to detect in the body generally and
    the female pregnant body specifically. During the third or fourth week after conception,
    skilled practitioners are able to feel the splitting off of this life force energy
    to support the emerging life of the embryo, allowing them to detect pregnancy. The
    word &#8216;<em>jee</em>&#8217; is related to &#8216;<em>jeevan</em>&#8217;, the
    Hindi word for life. Biomedicine has no equivalent to the notion of <em>jee</em>.
    Chi or ki in Chinese and Japanese medicine; vital force in homeopathy; <em>prana</em>
    or <em>ojas</em> in Ayurveda all signify life energy.
    <br />
    Health modalities and therapeutic systems based on facilitating and augmenting <em>jee</em>
    mainly concern themselves with removing blockages to the life force and maintaining
    or restoring balance in the body/person.
    <br />
    <br />
    Traditional midwives in many parts of the world have considered a birth occurring
    in the eighth month of pregnancy as particularly dangerous for the child. The <em>Susruta
        Samhita</em> explains this phenomenon &#8220;During the eighth month of pregnancy,
    there is instability in the ojas. If there is a delivery during this period, the
    child does not survive because of the absence of <em>ojas</em> in it&#8230;&#8221;
    This Ayurvedic knowledge is a part of indigenous midwifery, but totally absent from
    obstetrics. Interestingly, &#8216;granny&#8217; midwives in the United States also
    had this belief/knowledge about the dangers of the eighth month, but it has long
    been considered an &#8216;old wives tale.&#8217;
    <br />
    <br />
    Free flow of<em> jee</em> through the body maintains health. Obstructions or imbalances
    cause pathology. Removing blockages in the <em>nadis</em>, conduits for <em>jee</em>,
    is one of the functions of Indian forms of massage. Whereas western massage therapies
    use strokes promoting venous return (up the arms and legs, towards the heart), Indian
    massage techniques involve moving negative energies or blocks down the limbs and
    out of the body. The underlying concept of bodily functioning is radically different.
    Maintaining or restoring balance in the body is conceptualised as working on the
    following axes: hot and cold; up and down; open and closed, etc. Restoring balance
    of the <em>panch mahabhuta</em> (five elements), earth, air, fire, water and space,
    is also part of indigenous therapeutic work of promoting <em>jee</em>.

    <br />
    <h3>
        Cutting the Cord as a Great Paap (Sin)
    </h3>
    One <em>dai</em> in Rajasthan informed us that the dai was considered &#8220;a <em>ma</em>,
    <em>a vaidya</em>, and a <em>butcher</em>.&#8221; The &#8220;<em>ma</em>&#8221;
    is understandable as she supports, nurtures and &#8216;mothers&#8217; the mother.
    The &#8220;<em>vaidya</em>&#8221; is also comprehensible in terms of her ethno-medical
    role. The &#8220;butcher&#8221; is more problematic and central to the concept of
    the &#8220;sin&#8221; of cutting the cord. A butcher kills a live animal and cuts
    it up into parts, so others can eat it. A midwife also cuts flesh and divides babe
    from ma so that life can go on. All traditional <em>dais</em> wait until the placenta
    is delivered before tying and cutting the cord. When they speak in their idiom,
    they acknowledge it as a great <em>paap</em>, but a <em>paap</em> about which they
    never express guilt, shame (<em>sharam</em>) or regret.
    <br />
    <br />
    The cord is considered alive, as possessing <em>jeevan</em> (life). Another <em>Rajasthani
        dai </em>said the act of cutting the cord was considered a <em>paap</em> equal
    to the killing of a hundred cows. Other <em>dais</em> have stated that the umbilical
    cord has 72 <em>nadis</em> or channels for life energy. <em>Dais</em> usually offer
    something to the gods in connection with cutting the cord. From one perspective
    the <em>paap</em> of cord-cutting seems to be related to high caste attitudes towards
    the &#8216;down and dirty&#8217; birth work of <em>dais</em>.
    <br />
    <br />
    On the other hand, terming the cutting of the bond between mother and child &#8216;<em>paap</em>&#8217;
    also expresses the value of the mother-child bond and reverence for fleshy female
    blood ties. It appears that something alive, which possesses<em> jeevan</em>, is
    being violated by being severed. Perhaps this <em>paap</em> of cord cutting reflects
    an attitude similar to ahimsa or non-violence. Practitioners of folk and women&#8217;s
    ethnomedical traditions respect bodily integrity and utilize non-invasive therapeutics.
    <em>Dais</em>&#8217; varied and gentle techniques negotiate the inner body without
    violating the integrity of the skin/body/life force. Their holistic health modalities
    utilize touch (massage, pressure, manipulation) and natural resources (mud, baths
    and fomentation, herbs) and application of &#8216;hot and cold&#8217; (in food and
    drink, fomentation etc.) and isolation and protection (from domestic, maternal and
    sexual obligations).
    <br />
    <br />
    Not cutting the umbilical cord until the placenta is delivered is the common tradition
    throughout India, although <em>dais</em> are now being trained to cut it immediately
    according to the obstetrical model. Traditional women consider the infant-cord-placenta
    as an integral package. Baby and placenta have been together for nine months with
    this organ functioning to nurture the foetus. Why should they be severed too quickly?
    Midwives throughout the country use the placenta to resuscitate the baby if it is
    not breathing. The placenta is heated, sometimes by placing it on the <em>tava</em>,
    and<em> jee</em> flows from the <em>phool</em> to the <em>phul</em>, reviving it.
    One <em>dai</em> said &#8220;In the city doctors have injections, machines and all,
    to take care of such babies, but we only have the placenta, so we use it.&#8221;

    <h3>
        Recognition of Dais&#8217; Indigenous Cognitive Processes</h3>
    Yoga, <em>tantra</em>, Ayurveda, and meditation are globally recognised as being
    sophisticated mind-body interfaces which have emerged from the Indian subcontinent,
    but when it comes to knowledge of the <strong>female</strong> body, indigenous midwives
    are usually depicted as ignorant, superstitious, dirty and unskilled. As in other
    developing countries inheritors of indigenous midwifery traditions are considered
    fit only for training, and increasingly not even that. However, our data contains
    evidence of the scientific nature of midwifery, insofar as it is a knowledge <strong>
        system</strong>, learned via apprenticeship, and does not comprise just a few
    wise women popping up out of nowhere. We are also fortunate that in India we can
    benchmark the principles of dais knowledge/practice with Ayurvedic concepts.

    <br />
    The health status of poor and rural women and their babies cannot be improved without
    linkages, conceptual and practical, between biomedicine and ethno-medicine. Building
    on the culturally appropriate knowledge and skills of women is an important form
    of empowerment which avoids a common &#8216;development&#8217; trap of seeing women
    only in terms of violence, victimisation and vulnerability. Initiatives to reduce
    maternal mortality must be based on respectful exchanges between <strong>all</strong>
    service providers. Such dialogues are only possible if dais are recognized as decision-makers
    in their own domains and health professionals begin to speak the language of placenta,
    life force and sin.
