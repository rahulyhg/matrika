    All over the world women rise to their daily work, care for their families and participate
    in community life. Too often, women must face these challenges while struggling
    against illness&#8212;lacking even basic information about their health. (advertisement

    <h3>
        Locating Dais: A context for understanding dais&#8217; imagery of the female body</h3>
    I choose to begin this paper with the above quotes because they foreground the issue
    of what we might label the subaltern1 or subjugated knowledges of traditional Indian
    midwives, dais&#8212;and the exclusion of that knowledge and those who hold that
    knowledge from forums such as this. The first quote represents the dominant discourse
    on women&#8217;s health in India today and includes the presupposition that the
    majority (read poor, non-literate, non-English speaking) of women in such &#8216;underdeveloped&#8217;
    countries as India lack even basic health knowledge. Also included in this assertion
    is another presupposition&#8212;that allopathic medicine is the source of all health
    information. The &#8220;doctor&#8221; referred to is not a nurse-midwife or an ANM
    (auxiliary nurse midwife), a homeopathic practitioner, a vaidya or unnani doctor,
    an oja or ritual specialist, a masseuse, a herbalist or a dai nor even an elderly
    family member who has imbibed, over the years, her family and community healing
    modalities. No, the assumption is that &#8220;basic information about health&#8221;
    is available through doctors&#8212;that is, western bio-medically trained doctors.
    <br />
    <br />
    These commonly held assumptions disturb me and belie much of what I have learned
    in my 20 years of living, learning and working in India. MATRIKA (Motherhood and
    Traditional Resources, Knowledge, Information and Action) is a three year research
    project which I have initiated in order generate less bio-medically biased data.
    We have interacted with midwives and non-government organizations in three parts
    of North India: Bokharo District, Bihar; Lundkaransar District, Rajasthan; and slum
    areas of Delhi. In our workshops we have attempted to document, understand and reclaim
    indigenous women&#8217;s ethno-medical knowledge, practice and religio-cultural
    body imagery. This paper emerges from the Matrika effort.<br />
    My contentions in this paper are:
    <ul>
        <li>Health and body knowledge systems about the female body which are internally coherent,
            empirical and culturally embedded, exist within indigenously oriented (as opposed
            to cosmopolitan and globalised) communities. Indian women, generally, and midwives,
            particularly, have been the inheritors of rich and varied health information and
            body knowledges. </li>
        <li>Dais can be seen as indigenous specialists in women&#8217;s well being and cultural
            repositories of such body knowledge/practice. These knowledges are decentralised
            and collectively held; non-textual and orally transmitted; usually acquired by apprenticeship
            with an older relative and often caste based. </li>
        <li>Dominant, urban, English-educated elites, as well as global establishments have
            had considerable difficulties accessing, understanding, and appreciating indigenous
            body knowledge and its holders, dais, because of macro-level historical forces and
            because of epistemological (i.e. grounds of knowing) problems </li>
        <li>The historical forces (poverty, colonialism, Brahmanism and casteism, modernisation
            and development, social and intellectual neglect) have also eroded the quality of
            care offered by the midwives as well as their confidence in their own knowledge
            and customs. Dais, in their project of caring for parturient women, also cope with
            problems of ecological devastation (making access to food, water and healing herbs
            more difficult) and gender biases (spousal abuse, familial pressures for male offspring,
            female infanticide, etc.) </li>
        <li>Inadequate food, hunger and starvation of women and their families must be named
            as the crucial problem it is. It is absurd to tout Safe Motherhood and critique
            dais ignorance when the women whom they serve eat rice and salt for the nine months
            of their pregnancy. </li>
        <li>The reclamation, decoding and &#8216;rehabilitation&#8217; (because in our research
            we have seen much which needs rehabilitating) of indigenous knowledge and practice
            is not only important for poor and marginalised women. But also it is relevant to
            women&#8217;s health initiatives at all levels in India, as well as other &#8216;developed&#8217;
            and &#8216;developing&#8217; nations.</li>
        <li>Accessing and interpreting women&#8217;s body knowledges involves acceptance of
            blurred boundaries between categories sometimes considered mutually exclusive: mind/body;
            medicine/religion; sexuality/spirituality; woman-as-mother/woman-as-sexual being;
            purity/pollution; swarg (heaven)/narak (hell, demonic, underworld). Thus our reclamation
            involves an epistomologically challenging task!</li>
        <li>An empathetic understanding of body imagery requires a step outside of biomedical
            anatomy and physiology and an entree into a radically different &#8216;poetics&#8217;
            of bodies.</li>
    </ul>
    In most cultures birth has been handled primarily by women. The biomedical model
    of childbirth began to rely on technology (forceps and chloroform for Queen Victoria)
    rather than touch (massage and female support). Likewise this European ethno-medical
    approach to pregnancy and birth pathologised the female body&#8212;viewing it as
    a potential site of disease. European knowledge of anatomy was attained through
    the dissection of cadavers&#8212;hardly a good way to know about life and life-bearing
    bodies! Simultaneously women were eased out of their roles of caregivers and definitive
    knowers of their own bodies. Cosmopolitan obstetrics and technology can provide
    powerful, life saving interventions&#8212;but it is currently functioning to contaminate
    what is essentially a normal, natural life event (constructed differently in different
    cultures), not a medical one.
    <br />
    <br />
    In many parts of India midwifery was a part of the feudal jajmani system where dais,
    along with other artisans and service providers, were affiliated to a patron family.2
    In this context dais were compensated by gifts (grain, saris, etc.) not by money.
    Traditionally dai work is women&#8217;s work&#8212;an extension of household work
    and not given monetary value. Many traditional dais find negotiating commercial
    exchange networks difficult, if not impossible. Today this lack of skill and tradition
    is further complicated by the extreme poverty of those women whom they serve. Many
    of the older and more &#8216;traditional&#8217; dais say that their work is done
    with the feeling of service. One dai asked &#8220;How can I refuse to help a woman
    in labour just because she has no money and is poor&#8212;so has nothing to pay?&#8221;
    Three elderly and very experienced Rajasthani dais with whom we interacted had worked
    for years breaking stones for road building because the earnings of their traditional
    occupation could not sustain them.
    <br />
    <br />
    The undervaluation of dai&#8217;s contribution was a part of British colonial devaluation
    of indigenous health practitioners generally. Midwives were negatively impacted
    by two ideological thrusts of imperial rule: the superiority of western notions
    of health and the backwardness of women&#8217;s status. Operationally vast armies
    of &#8216;lady health visitors&#8217; were loosed on the countryside to clean up
    and educate ignorant, &#8216;backward&#8217; women and the dais who served them.
    Surely the bleak picture of traditional midwives which we have today has come, in
    part, from that very successful colonial enterprise which rescued Indian women from
    their &#8216;barbaric and superstitious&#8217; body knowledge and traditions. 3
    At the same time obstetric biomedicine, a model of childbirth now being contested
    and negotiated by many in the west, was promoted as modern, hygienic and safe.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
        Who is a Dai?</h3>
    Approximately one million women work as traditional midwives in India and attend
    60% of births. In poor and rural areas, as many as 90%. Dais share the cultural
    and ethno-medical orientations of the women whom they serve. Dais are also often
    the only affordable and accessible practitioners available to poor urban and rural
    women.
    <br />
    <br />
    However, we encounter many problems when attempting to speak about traditional midwifery.
    The first one is who is a dai? And what is dai work? In <em>Labour Pains</em> and
    <em>Labour Power</em>, by Roger and Patricia Jeffreys and Andrew Lyons (considered
    by many to be a definitive work on childbirth in India) the dai is presented as
    a substandard obstetrician. Not surprisingly these materialist sociologists do not
    look at culture and also did their work where women never return to their natal
    homes for even first births&#8212;surely an anomaly in traditional Indian families.
    <br />
    <br />
    About five years ago the head of UNICEF in Delhi told me that they had cut back
    on funds for dai training because their anthropological studies showed that nobody
    could identify, precisely, who was (and who was not) a dai. He went on to say that
    UNICEF was thus funding efforts to educate pregnant women as to the danger signs
    of childbirth&#8212;because she was the only person they were absolutely certain
    would be present at the time of the birth! I felt this was a terrible decision for
    many reasons:
    <ul>
        <li>mothers who are haemorrhaging do not have the capacity to influence decisions regarding
            their care;</li>
        <li>not being able to anthropologically describe indigenous, ethno-medical support systems
            does not mean that they do not exist; </li>
        <li>modern institutions which bypass indigenous practitioners&#8217; support and knowledge
            serves to undermine and replace them, often with &#8216;sui-goli&#8217; (injections
            and pills) medicine dispensed by &#8216;quacks&#8217;. Such quacks are compounders,
            RMPs (rural medical practitioners), traditional vaidyas (who sometimes dispense
            allopathic drugs as well as Ayurvedic remedies). </li>
    </ul>
    It should not surprise us that modern institutions and their representatives have
    been confounded by the phenomenon of traditional midwifery. Especially when we consider
    Sukumari Bhattacharji, Sanskrit scholar and historian, on the dai:<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        The dai is a substitute priest working between two worlds (like the priest&#8217;s
        intermediacy between the sacred and the mundane). She mediates the prenatal, foetal,
        and the parturition/ postnatal. And, like the priest, or more like the shaman, she
        discharges her function through control of the spirit world. This is because there
        are demons which seek to delay, prevent or muck up the birth (causing a defective
        or stillborn babe or the postpartum diseases or death of the mother). Birth means
        the advent of a departed soul in a new incarnation, a fact which has cosmic significance,
        hence other hostile souls/spirits/persons seek to prevent it.
        <br />
        <br />
        The dai&#8217;s unique position is equivalent of a shamaness&#8217;s. She pre-empts
        male intervention in a literal rite de passage. She was allowed this privilege possibly
        because the whole process is &#8216;dirty&#8217;. The Asvins, the divine physicians,
        were deprived of the soma drink in the later Vedic-Epic literature because as physicians
        they had to touch uncleanness connected with disease. Later Indian literature lays
        down that doctors may not be ritual guests.
        <br />
        <br />
        The role of the initiating priest, the acarya, in the Upanayana (sacred thread)
        ceremony, is similar to the dai. The sacred thread is a replica of the umbilical
        cord in reverse: the dai removes it, the acarya winds it on the ritually newborn.<br />
        <br />
        The birth rite is the only wholly female rite where male presence is precluded;
        yet it is solemn, awesome and throbbing with tension. Birth rites uniquely empower
        the female assistant and are the only rites where a new life enters the earthly
        plane. The dai is symbolic of mother earth. Whereas the earth gives birth unaided,
        in a human birth she symbolically splits herself in two: the mother and the dai.
        This is because human mothers, unlike the prima dea, are not self-procreative and
        are also exposed to dangers from the spirit world.4
    </p>
    <br />
    Locating the dai is a bit like the story of the men touching the elephant and each
    feeling a different part!
    <br />

    <h3>
        Entree into Imagery: Hawa, Gola and Mother-in-law&#8217;s Big Toe</h3>
    During the workshop phase of our MATRIKA research I visited a respected Ayurvedic
    physician in order to discuss our initial findings. He opened the conversation by
    stating that dais&#8217; and Ayurvedic knowledge and practice were similar. I have
    learned much from dais about the female body and birth which is not in the Ayurvedic
    texts (at least the English translations available to me) and which seems quite
    different from vaidya&#8217;s practice. So I stated that there were major differences
    between the textual and the folk streams of indigenous body knowledge and I gave
    an example. In a workshop in Gomia, Bihar, we were told that if a woman&#8217;s
    labour was not progressing she was made to drink a glass of water in which her mother-in-law&#8217;s
    big toe had been dipped. Of course this ritual facilitation of labour had pushed
    both our hygiene and feminist buttons. How dirty! How demeaning! But nonetheless
    we noted it down and it is this rite which came to my mind as an example of something
    dais might do, but surely would have no place in dignified Ayurvedic practice.
    <br />
    <br />
    It is always a good thing for a researcher to have her hypotheses challenged. And
    that&#8217;s exactly what happened. Respected vaidya, when he heard the above folk
    facilitation, immediately noted that in Ayurveda the nadi for pran vayu (which is
    understood to be a carrier of knowledge and experience) exits the body via the big
    toes. Thus the custom of touching elders&#8217; feet allows for the transmission
    of their knowledge to those of lesser knowledge-experience. It is logical to assume,
    thus, that the mapping of the body implicit in the mother-in-law&#8217;s big toe
    ritual is similar to the mapping in Ayurvedic understanding. The social hierarchy
    of mother-in-law/daughter-in-law is perhaps encoded in this rite, transmitting the
    respected female elder&#8217;s permission for the birth to proceed&#8212;granting
    the status of maternity to the bahu, but at the same time asserting her authority
    and primacy. Certainly the folk understanding of the inner terrain of the body is
    closer to that of Ayurveda than it is to the anatomy and physiology of allopathic
    medicine.<br />
    <br />
    During another interview with a dai in Bihar she said &#8220;If labour is getting
    delayed then I make her wash the toe of the person with whom she had fought during
    her pregnancy. She drinks this water.&#8221; It appears that conflict resolution,
    in order to facilitate the labour, is also affected through the toe-water ritual!
    I have also learned from a scholar of Tantra that sadhus are loath to have their
    feet touched, perhaps fearing this transmission and the diminishing of their powers.5
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
        Hawa-gola as energy, not anatomy-physiology</h3>
    In our very first workshops we began hearing some unfamiliar terms such as &#8216;hawa&#8217;
    which is loosely translated as wind, but more specifically in Ayurveda means movement
    or motion. Colloquially hawa can refer to the activities of spirit forces, usually
    with negative associations, as in &#8216;burra hawa&#8217;, a bad wind.<br />
    <br />
    We initially understood another term &#8216;gola&#8217;, meaning ball or something
    round, as a clot, but now think of it as matter associated with force or energy.
    It was, and still is, difficult to ferret out what the meanings of hawa-gola are&#8212;but
    one thing was perfectly clear. The dais emphasised that hawa-gola are threats to
    the woman&#8217;s well being postpartum as they are some kind of matter, force or
    energy which must come out of the body (through the vagina or birth canal), and
    by all means not go up into the upper part of the body.
    <br />
    <br />
    I was not totally unfamiliar with the concept of things going up in the body. As
    a natural childbirth instructor I had interacted with a few traditionally-oriented
    mothers and mother-in-laws of pregnant women who used to talk of the uterus moving
    up into the chest during labour. It occurred to me that that these women were not
    speaking of the literal organ, the womb, shifting position upward&#8212;but of a
    bodily energy which was supposed to be in the belly, being in the chest. This was
    not a strange idea because childbirth educators, and those experienced in helping
    women give birth, are familiar with mothers&#8217; bearing down efforts being misplaced&#8212;and
    the need to help women direct their efforts toward the abdominal area rather than
    the throat or chest. I have also heard many doctors scoff at &#8216;ignorant&#8217;
    women&#8217;s references to &#8216;the uterus moving up&#8217; thinking they were
    simply unfamiliar with their bodies. They were not aware that women were using an
    anatomical term to refer to a process-oriented phenomenon. This seems to be a key
    in understanding some of dais&#8217; language which refers to a life energy rather
    than anatomy.
    <br />
    <br />
    Notions of <strong>direction</strong> are important in body mapping in Indian spiritual
    traditions as the male is counselled to conserve his semen so the reservoir of energy,
    called kundalini, can be directed upwards, towards the crown chakra and enlightenment,
    rather than downwards in the service of sexual pleasure and procreation. That this
    mapping is hardly confined to yogis and sadhus is displayed by the popularity of
    traditional sex clinics, which treat impotence. Young males, it seems, are often
    fraught with conflicts and insecurities, I would suggest, relating to this battleground
    of mappings involving the meanings and valuations of sexual bodily fluids and &#8216;directionality&#8217;.
    <br />
    <br />
    In our first Delhi workshop Ram Pyari, a 70ish dai from Rajasthan who had lived
    and practised in a resettlement colony of Delhi, for many years, said:<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        In the hospital no one is allowed to accompany the pregnant woman. If the labour
        is very long they make a cut. This can get infected. Hospitals cause a lot of infections.
        The woman can get swellings and golas. If there are golas we should give hot fomentation
        to clear the tubes</p>
    <br />
    Ram Pyari names a crucial need of the labouring woman&#8212;by its absence in the
    hospital context&#8212;that of someone to accompany the woman during the process
    of the labour. All dais emphasise that empathetic, knowledgeable women are needed
    to support the jachcha (literally she who births) physically, psychologically and
    also to negotiate the dangers which threaten the process. This negotiation often
    involves diagnostics and ritual interventions which we moderns label &#8216;superstitious&#8217;.
    <br />
    <br />
    Bhagwania, an experienced and confident dai from Gomia, Bihar, in our second Bihar
    workshop claimed:<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        After the placenta is out we try to get out the dirty blood by pressing her stomach
        with our hands and even using the head. Two clots of blood come out&#8212;gangi
        and jamuni. The woman gets a lot of relief from this.</p>
    <br />
    As much as we discussed and tried to understand these terms in our own, basically
    biomedical, framework, our Matrika team made little progress and just kept questioning
    and searching for possible linkages with our world&#8212;as well as simply listening
    and trying to enter theirs. At this second Bihar workshop we also gathered information
    about a maternal death, which occurred within a few hours after birth. This investigation,
    funded by UNFPA, led to a report, <em>Saroj&#8217;s Death</em>: <em>Multiple Perspectives
        on One Maternal Death</em>, in which we probed possible meanings of postpartum
    embolism and thrombosis&#8212;obstetrical diagnostics. We followed an interpretative
    path that gola might be equivalent to a blood clot; and hawa, a pulmonary embolism&#8212;both
    of which can be fatal.
    <br />
    <br />
    Bhagwania used the nomenclature &#8216;gangi-jamni&#8217; for these &#8216;clots&#8217;
    of blood. This language shows a correlation between energy or blood pathways in
    the body and the great rivers of the Gangetic plain. This way of speaking, and diagnosing,
    reveals the dais&#8217; ethno-medical tendency to hold knowledge in terms of correspondences
    between natural processes&#8217;&#8212;here the cleansing and circulatory functions
    of the female body and the earth body are rendered as analogous.
    <br />
    <br />
    Both dais&#8217; ethno-medicine and obstetrics advocate the mother&#8217;s physical
    movement immediately postpartum. Obstetrical rationale is that because of the increased
    venous activity, extra blood in the uterine, vaginal and thigh area, the circulatory
    system needs to be stimulated in order to prevent thrombosis and embolism formation.
    The dais explain that &#8216;stagnant&#8217;, &#8216;bad&#8217; or &#8216;kala&#8217;
    blood needs to move and be expelled so that golas will not move upwards in the body
    and cause problems for the new mother. (It is fascinating to hypothesise, but impossible
    to prove, that the original impulse behind so-called &#8216;pollution taboos&#8217;
    is this conceptualisation that the blood of menstruation and childbirth are cleansing
    functions of the female body. According to this logic this blood is &#8216;bad&#8217;
    because it is no longer needed by the body and if retained, is dangerous to the
    woman.)
    <br />
    <br />
    We learned more about gola in our first workshop in Rajasthan, Lundkaransar District.
    Here the dais were particularly homogeneous in their practice and culture. The following
    is a discussion from that workshop in which they are trying to help us understand
    what gola is and how they handle it.<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        Manori: After the birth of the baby the woman has pains in the gola. Because when
        the baby is in the womb then gola is the protector of the baby. Gola is located
        beside the baby. After birth gola is left alone so it looks for the baby in the
        womb. And this gives pain to the new mother. Therefore we immediately give warm
        halwa to the mother to eat and this foments the gola. A warm pot is placed on the
        abdomen for fomentation. This eases her pain.<br />
        Guddi: This is a gola of jama hua khoon (stagnant or clotted blood). It bleeds out
        in three days and the abdomen is cured.<br />
        Manori: Gola can be felt on touching the abdomen. After delivery the woman is made
        to stand and the dai puts her head against the woman&#8217;s abdomen. She takes
        out all the collected blood (jama hua khoon). This is called kala khoon (black blood).
        Later we make the woman sit and put our heel on her shareer (here perineum is meant).
        By this her shareer does not come out. (i.e. uterine prolapse is avoided)
    </p>
    <br />
    Shifting meanings, nuances of goal are apparent here. Gola, on one hand, seems to
    be the womb&#8212;&#8220;pains in the gola&#8221; which we recognise as contractions.
    Gola seems to be both womb and womb energy&#8212;and consequences derived from that
    gestational power.
    <br />
    <br />
    In our second Delhi workshop we also had discussions on postpartum and gola.<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        Praveen: Gola is not blood. Gola is the rakhwala, the protector of the baby. When
        the baby comes out, it (gola) searches for the baby, it goes around in the womb.
        Therefore there is pain. When it does not find the baby then it gets tired and defeated
        and settles.<br />
        Pushpa: Also, by eating this space gets filled up and slowly the pain goes away.
        By having food in the stomach pressure is applied and the space gets filled. This
        way the pain goes away.<br />
        Vidya Devi: Yes, by eating-drinking things like ghee, ajwain&#8212;whatever is the
        custom&#8212;the distension goes away.<br />
        Praveen: Amongst us, alongside the head of the woman a gola (i.e. something round),
        a coconut, is broken. This makes the pain go away. A small piece of coconut is given
        to the jachcha and rest is distributed among other people.<br />
        Kamala: Gola is the baby&#8217;s home. When the house becomes empty, only ganda
        khoon is left. When blood will come out then there will be pain. Ajwain, saunth,
        pipar&#8212;this is ground and mixed in boiling water with jaggery. If this is given
        to drink then the belly clears up.<br />
        Dhapo: Even when it moves a little it is like &#8216;pran nikal jata hai.&#8217;
        (the life force goes out of you, like death.) The dai presses the place from where
        it moves. Then it stays on the side of the lower portion of the abdomen.</p>
    <br />
    On one hand this gola, in obstetric physiological terms, is related to the contracting
    uterus. As a muscular organ the womb, which has stretched to accommodate the growing
    baby, begins to contract after the birth&#8212;involution it is called. Especially
    when women have many children (the womb having been stretched many times) postpartum
    contractions can be very painful. And yet this gola signifies in many more realms
    than simple anatomical functioning. I think it is important to note</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There is an active notion of the space the baby has occupied. The gola is &#8216;the
            baby&#8217;s home&#8217;. It &#8216;searches for the baby&#8217; after birth.</li>
        <li>Pain is understood to be caused by this &#8216;search&#8217; for the baby.</li>
        <li>&#8216;Heating&#8217;&#8212;fomentation and hot foods are therapeutic interventions
            to deal with gola. </li>
        <li>Massage to expel the &#8216;bad blood&#8217; is also a postpartum therapy to manipulate
            the space and control it.</li>
    </ul>
    At our last Delhi workshop we also got the following information:<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        Dhappo: Bhagwan puts gola along with the bacha. This gola roams around.<br />
        Deepti: Is this anwal (placenta)?<br />
        Tara: This is gola. This roams around and by this, it is said that mother&#8217;s
        mamta (maternal love) increases. It is looking for the baby.<br />
        Naseem: After the birth of the baby, in the womb gabelan (gola or fire) arises.
        This searches for the baby.<br />
        Tara: It is for six days.<br />
        Pushpa: It reduces by eating.<br />
        Rani: There are four terms for it&#8212;gabelan, gola, aag, and mamta.
        <br />
        <br />
        Above I have noted that one dai used the terminology of gangi-jamni to describe
        the
        <br />
        &#8216;clots&#8217; which needed to be expelled by the body after the birth. This
        way of naming phenomena and processes in terms of correspondences utilises microcosm-macrocosm
        analogues. In Ayurvedic understanding the theory of the panch mahabhuta (earth,
        air, fire, water and &#8216;ether&#8217;) explains how internal bodily forces and
        external cosmic forces are linked together. What is inside the body has its correlates
        externally in the natural world. The health of the body is represented as a balance
        of the panch mahabhuta which actually are viewed as forces rather than substances.
        Likewise all physiological processes involve delicate balancing acts between these
        forces. Dais descriptions of postpartum hawa-gola and also aag (fire) seem to use
        similar mapping of bodily forces which need to be kept in balance during labour
        and birth for the health of the mother.
        <br />
        <br />
        In Ayurvedic thought the panch mahabhuta condense to the three doshas: vata, pitta
        and kapha which are, effectively air, fire and water respectively
        <br />
        <br />
        Interestingly one Ayurvedic scholar writes:
        <br />
        <br />
        In the mind vata retrieves previous data from memory for comparison with new data.
        Pitta processes the new data and draws conclusions, which vata then stores as new
        memories.
        <br />
        <br />
        Certainly the female bodily shift from pregnant to not-pregnant is one of the most
        profound normative changes the human body could undergo! It seems that the dais
        are describing this shift in indigenous ethno-medical terminology&#8212;and this
        involves notions<br />
        fire, wind and energy.</p>
    <br />
    The now-empty womb is also a potential problem because the space must be filled
    (by food and drink, warm fomentation, massage). Excessive empty space in the body
    with insufficient power of movement can result in stasis (gola?) with adverse implications
    for health.
    <br />
    <br />
    In all the areas in which we have worked--Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab and Bihar&#8212;as
    well as in reports from South India, dais do not cut the umbilical cord until after
    the placenta is delivered. They use the placenta, still connected to the baby, as
    a resuscitation device if the child is not breathing&#8212;stimulating it by heating.
    It is important for us to notice that these ethno-medical practitioners have extensive
    knowledge of, and use interventions based on, bodily parts considered highly &#8216;polluting&#8217;
    in the brahmanic texts and the high caste Hindu mind. One Delhi dai, Kamala, stated
    that if the naal (cord) is cut then there is the danger of the placenta climbing
    up. Furthermore she stated that<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        We never throw away the placenta. The way the child is dear to us, so is the anwal
        is also precious. For nine months it has protected and sustained the child, so how
        can we just throw it away?
    </p>
    <br />
    A feminist hermeneutics demands that we consider carefully this valuation of the
    flesh and blood bonds between maternal and child bodies and not simply turn away
    in civilized distaste.
    <br />
    <br />
    Furthermore it seems that in these representations the womb is rendered as a sensate,
    perceptive organ. This is a radical departure from western anatomical understanding<br />
    of the uterus which considers the organ incapable of sensation&#8212;the pain of
    childbirth is considered to be cause by pull and pressure on other surrounding body
    parts. The dais imagery attributes to the womb a capacity to sense and to know (of
    course the womb is not dislocated from the person of the mother, as in western anatomy).
    <br />
    <br />
    For our purposes, the representation of space and womb as active attributes a kind
    of agency lacking in bio-medical obstetrics&#8212;and is congruent with hands-on,
    non-invasive and woman-centered post birth care. The womb, or gola, is depicted
    as searching for the baby&#8212;thus the use of the word mamta&#8212;motherly love&#8212;attachment,
    literally.
    <br />
    <br />
    These mappings of the body are holistic or non-dualistic. Finally the gola is the
    rakhwala of the baby&#8212;its keeper, responsible for it. I would interpret this
    gola energy to be the life force sustaining and growing the fetus. And it is precisely
    that same energy which has the potential to turn against the mother and harm her
    if it stays in the body and moves upward. This gola energy must be released by the
    maternal body down and out&#8212;with the help of the dais. And it is related to
    the bad blood or kala, ganda khoon which signifies that no-longer-needed channel
    for the life force energy.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
        Narak ka Samay&#8212;Priestly defined impurity or dai&#8217;s ethno-medical terrain?</h3>
    Dais use terms such as &#8216;narak ka samay&#8217; and &#8216;nau mahenae ka narak
    kund&#8217; to speak of the postpartum period. Strictly speaking from the time of
    the cutting of the umbilical cord to chatti or the post-birth ritual (time differing
    among different castes and communities) the woman, baby, dai and woman&#8217;s family
    are unclean or untouchable. We moderns view these &#8216;superstitions&#8217; through
    lenses constructed by brahmanism, colonialism and orientalism. Our Matrika project
    is attempting to explore this ritual construction of time and mapping of the female
    body in non-value laden terms (i.e. devoid of their negative caste and gender associations).
    We are attending to the dais&#8217; words within their own context in order to understand
    them as purely descriptive language for female life-body events. My own working
    hypothesis is emerging that ritual uncleanness is the language of brahmanic sacerdotal
    and textual tradition and that women&#8217;s work of birth involves different forms
    of sacrality and ethno-medical rite and practice.
    <br />
    <br />
    Repeatedly dais use the word narak to describe the birth time. They also use narak
    in relation to the lower part of the body&#8212;including reproductive organs. In
    Bihar, at least, women were clear that that the mundane, ordinary world is equivalent
    to the midsection--chest, arms and back and the heavenly realm, to the head. We
    recognise a similar division found in the Rig Vedic Purush, the cosmic man divided
    up, considered to be prototype for caste delineations.
    <br />
    <br />
    During our second Bihar workshop we learned<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        On Chhati day the narak time ends. The dai checks if the umbilical cord of the baby
        has fallen. Then she bathes the baby and beats a thaali and gives the baby to chaachi
        who does namaskar to Bhagwan and gives the baby to jethani. The jachcha is bathed
        and she wears new clothes. The dai cleans the room where the delivery took place
        and the woman was kept separately for six days. She washes the dirty clothes of
        mother and child and then is herself given soap and oil for bathing. Then the woman&#8217;s
        sasural (husband&#8217;s home) people go and invite maike (wife&#8217;s natal home)
        people&#8212;they come and are welcomed by sprinkling of water and being embraced.
        <br />
        <br />
        The woman&#8217;s mother brings new clothes for her son-in-law and samdhis. The
        new mother is dressed up, puts sindur and kaajal. Different types of food are cooked&#8212;from
        today she can eat everything. Next day the dai takes leave. The saas puts sindoor
        and kaajal for her. The dai is given a new sari, rice and sometimes money. On the
        third day after the chhati puja they have simple kuan puja. The new mother puts
        tika on a well or pond.</p>
    <br />
    Ritual, birth time, and women&#8217;s bodily knowledge and practice are interwoven
    with concepts of narak. From an interview with Saubatia, a Bihari dai<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        We do not give any medicines for swellings. We give hot fomentation with arandi
        oil. The placenta and cord are buried near the chula. We see that during pregnancy
        water is retained in a woman&#8217;s body. Food is only given on the second day
        after delivery. The two days of fast is called narak upwaas. Food is only given
        after all the dirty blood comes out. If she has delivered in the morning then in
        the evening tea, bread and gur-haldi sweet is given. Nothing is given at night.
        She only drinks warm or hot water. The stomach bloats if one drinks cold water.</p>
    <br />
    Although often translated as hellish or demonic place, Narak can be understood as
    the site/energy of the unseen inner world - of the earth and of the body.6 Narak
    has the connotation &#8216;filth&#8217; but also signifies the fertility or fruitful
    potential of the earth and the female body. So called &#8216;pollution taboos&#8217;
    are related to narak&#8212;where the idea of the sacred is radically separated from
    the reproductive potential of the female body. During menstruation and post birth
    women are &#8216;unclean&#8217;. However the dai speaks with a very different voice
    than the pundit about narak. To her the placenta, the ultimate polluting substance
    in the shastras, is spoken of reverently. It is no coincidence that dais are mainly
    from low and outcaste communities. Both caste and gender are involved in concepts
    of narak. , (Ayurvedic and naturopathic practitioners often employ low caste people
    to apply the hands-on therapies which prescribed by them).
    <br />
    <br />
    The concept of narak is a foundational idea which also allows for a host of therapeutic
    interventions. Narak seems to signify the inner world of the body, which is invisible
    to the eye-- particularly to the mysterious procreative power of the female body.
    This concept then provides a mode of understanding which allows practitioners and
    therapeutics which can negotiate and affect the inner body without violating the
    integrity of the skin/body/life force. And indeed the dais&#8217; health modalities
    are high-touch (massage, pressure, manipulation); use natural resources (mud, baths
    and fomentation, herbs); and application of &#8216;hot and cold&#8217; (in food
    and drink, fomentation etc.); isolation and protection (from household work and
    maternal and sexual obligations).
    <br />
    <br />
    And repeatedly we heard how integral the notion of uncleanness is to dai&#8217;s
    management of mother&#8217;s postpartum care. From our last Delhi workshop<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        Kamala: According to me, the baby is born. Then gola roams around. This gola took
        care of the baby. Warm fomentation is done and gola finishes&#8212;this is maila
        (dirt), it gets cleaned and the gandh (filth) comes out.
        <br />
        <br />
        Kaushalya: My thing is that whether you say gola or you call it lothara (lump) or
        call it anything, it is inside the bachadani (womb, literally holder of the baby).
        The gandigi (filth) is blocked because of this reason. It roams around everywhere
        and then the pain comes&#8212;with this the gandigi comes out. This cleans the whole
        womb.
    </p>
    <br />
    I would suggest that this gandigi and narak is diagnostic nomenclature in the language
    of midwives and does not partake of the pejorative caste and gender laden meanings
    of the twice born.
    <br />
    <br />
    Dais imagery of the female body involves analogies and correspondences&#8212;the
    placenta being analogous with the kund or spring. Narak emerges as meaning unseen
    source, of water and of human life&#8212;the underworld is demonic or hellish only
    in that it is the nether, chthonic world of the body of the earth/woman&#8212;both
    fertile and finally outside of patriarchal control.
    <br />
    <br />
    In concluding I would like to distance myself and our work from two popular misconceptions
    about women such as dais. First is that they are individual &#8216;wise women&#8217;
    who suddenly seem to appear out of nowhere. Such women are represented as being
    extremely intuitive and devoid of any &#8216;learning&#8217; or cultural context.
    Dais&#8217; knowledge and practice is embedded in a shared, collectively held religio-cultural
    context. Dais, although they may rely on ways of knowing we might label intuition,
    have learned their skills through experience and/or apprenticeship. For this reason
    it is very important to refer to indigenous knowledge traditions. Secondly, that
    somehow lower class and poor women are simply closer to nature and thus birth easily.
    Although this may have a modicum of truth in it, humans have a tremendous capacity
    for learned behaviour&#8212;which will override &#8216;nature&#8217;. We must not
    confuse a culture of birth and of the body (which may be more congruent with &#8216;nature&#8217;)
    with primitivism and doing things au natural.
    <br />
    <br />
    These myths demean the sophistication and complexity of dais&#8217; knowledge and
    body imagery&#8212;which I have hopefully demonstrated above.
