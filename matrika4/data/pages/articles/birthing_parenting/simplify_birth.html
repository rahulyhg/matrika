	<h1>Simplifying Birth</h1>
	When I was in charge of the maternity unit of the Pithiviers, France,
	hospital, my main objective was to improve the birth environment in
	order to facilitate the physiological processes. This is how the
	midwives, a group of mothers and I proceeded to transform one of the
	conventional delivery rooms into a small home-like birthing room - a
	small square nest. This room has since been imitated in different
	maternity hospitals. Most of our visitors did not realize the importance
	of the size of the room, which should be as small as possible. They did
	not understand the reality and nature of the nesting instinct. <br />
	<br />
	Another of the aims was to enable the mother-to-be to gain familiarity
	with the birthing place. It is obviously easier to satisfy the need for
	privacy in a familiar place. It is not enough to have had a guided tour
	of the facilities. In order to become really familiar with a place, you
	have to be there often and keep returning to do something. And it is
	better if you are doing something pleasant.... We found an answer that
	was perfectly adapted to our maternity unit. Once a week, the pregnant
	women and the staff would be given the opportunity to meet and sing
	around the piano. What could be easier or more pleasant? It was not
	expensive. Somebody found that you could buy 12 second-hand pianos for
	the price of one electronic fetal monitor.... <br />
	<br />
	In order to rediscover the basic needs of laboring women we might
	express a simple rule of thumb: where labor, delivery and birth are
	concerned, what is specifically human must be eliminated and the
	mammalian needs must be met. The first step should be to get rid of the
	aftermath of all the beliefs (inseparable from rituals) that have
	disturbed for millennia the physiological processes in all known
	cultural milieus. The belief that colostrom is harmful is a typical
	example. Such beliefs conferred an evolutionary advantage as long as the
	basic strategy for survival of most human groups was to dominate Nature
	and to dominate other human groups. It was an advantage to develop the
	human potential for aggression. Today humanity urgently needs to invent
	new strategies for survival. In order to develop respect for Mother
	Earth and to unify our global village, the priority is to develop a
	capacity to love rather than potential for aggression. So all the
	beliefs and rituals that disturb the physiological processes are losing
	their evolutionary advantage. <br />
	<br />
	Let us add that a reduction in the activity of the neocortex is the most
	important aspect of birth physiology and that the neocortex is that part
	of the brain that is so highly developed among humans. All inhibitions
	during the birth process originate in the neocortex. That is why the
	spectacular development of the neocortex is our specific handicap in
	childbirth. When the activity of the neocortex is reduced, the laboring
	woman is as if "on another planet," cutting herself off from our world.
	She can become almost as instinctive as other mammals. This leads us to
	understand that the laboring woman needs to be protected against any
	sort of neocortical stimulation. Language, which is specifically human,
	is one of the most powerful stimulants of that part of the brain that is
	highly developed in our species. Not feeling observed and feeling secure
	both tend to reduce cortical activity; they are basic needs during the
	parturition of mammals. <br />

	S. has spent her entire midwifery career at [an Oregon hospital].... She
	developed a woman-centered practice with a noninterventive philosophy.
	She has never been to a homebirth.... S.'s devotion to the protection of
	normal labor and birth is bolstered by her consistent attention to
	research in medicine and obstetrics. However, the things I saw her do to
	make a birth in a hospital labor and delivery ward home-like were simple
	and basic. For one, she took the monitor out of the room. It was
	surprising to me, a midwife who has attended many hundreds of home and
	hospital births, how much difference this made. It felt different than
	just not using the monitor. It was gone. The room was simplified, the
	energy purified. <br />
	<br />
	She went on to create a private space for the parents. On the floor
	behind the hospital bed a futon was placed, and a large cushion was
	added for comfort and support. The door to the room was closed and
	access monitored by the midwife. I was reminded of Dr. Michel Odent's
	advice to decrease the adrenaline levels in the laboring mother by
	providing a quiet, private place with the lights turned down low, the
	kind of place animals seek out for their births. <br />

	<h3>Research to Remember</h3>
	A recent study published in the British Medical Journal showed what
	midwives, moms and other advocates for homebirth have known all along -
	homebirths attended by certified midwives are safer than hospital
	births. Rates of medical intervention, such as epidural, forceps and
	caesarean section, were lower for planned homebirths than for low-risk
	hospital births. Planned homebirths also had a low mortality rate during
	labor and delivery, similar to that in most studies of low-risk hospital
	births in North America. The study also showed a high satisfaction rate
	by mothers. In 87% of the cases, no transfer to a hospital was required.
	The results support the American Public Health Association's (APHA)
	recommendation to increase access to out of hospital maternity care
	services with direct entry midwives in the United States. <br />
