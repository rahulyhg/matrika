	<h1>Amniotomy for shortening spontaneous labour</h1>

	<h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
	Evidence does not support the routine breaking the waters for women in
	spontaneous labour. The aim of breaking the waters (also known as
	artificial rupture of the membranes, ARM, or amniotomy), is to speed up
	and strengthen contractions, and thus shorten the length of labour. The
	membranes are punctured with a crochet-like long-handled hook during a
	vaginal examination, and the amniotic fluid floods out. Rupturing the
	membranes is thought to release chemicals and hormones that stimulate
	contractions. Amniotomy has been standard practice in recent years in
	many countries around the world. In some centres it is advocated and
	performed routinely in all women, and in many centres it is used for
	women whose labours have become prolonged. However, there is little
	evidence that a shorter labour has benefits for the mother or the baby.
	There are a number of potential important but rare risks associated with
	amniotomy, including problems with the umbilical cord or the baby's
	heart rate. <br />

	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<h4><b>Background</b></h4>
	Intentional artificial rupture of the amniotic membranes during labour,
	sometimes called amniotomy or 'breaking of the waters', is one of the
	most commonly performed procedures in modern obstetric and midwifery
	practice. The primary aim of amniotomy is to speed up contractions and,
	therefore, shorten the length of labour. However, there are concerns
	regarding unintended adverse effects on the woman and baby. <br />
	<h4><b>Objectives</b></h4>
	To determine the effectiveness and safety of amniotomy alone for (1)
	routinely shortening all labours that start spontaneously, and (2)
	shortening labours that have started spontaneously, but have become
	prolonged. <br />
	<h4><b>Search Strategy</b></h4>
	We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials
	Register (30 March 2007). <br />
	<h4><b>Selection Criteria</b></h4>
	Randomised controlled trials comparing amniotomy alone versus intention
	to preserve the membranes. We excluded quasi-randomised trials. <br />
	<h4><b>Data collection and Analysis</b></h4>
	Two authors assessed identified studies for inclusion. Both authors
	extracted data. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. <br />
	<h4><b>Main results</b></h4>
	We have included 14 studies in this review, involving 4893 women. There
	was no evidence of any statistical difference in length of first stage
	of labour (weighted mean difference -20.43 minutes, 95% confidence
	interval (CI) -95.93 to 55.06), maternal satisfaction with childbirth
	experience (standardised mean difference 0.27, 95% CI -0.49 to 1.04) or
	low Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to
	1.05). Amniotomy was associated with an increased risk of delivery by
	caesarean section compared to women in the control group, although the
	difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.98 to
	1.62).<br />
	There was no consistency between papers regarding the timing of
	amniotomy during labour in terms of cervical dilatation. <br />
	<h4><b>Authors' Conclusions</b></h4>
	On the basis of the findings of this review, we cannot recommend that
	amniotomy should be introduced routinely as part of standard labour
	management and care. We do recommend that the evidence presented in this
	review should be made available to women offered an amniotomy and may be
	useful as a foundation for discussion and any resulting decisions made
	between women and their caregivers.</div>
