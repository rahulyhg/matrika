	The classification of birthing knowledge as "specialist" has prepared
	the way for the dramatized caricature represented in popular media.
	Drama is the key to capturing an audience's attention, and the media
	provides the desired product. Ina May Gaskin observes that "the demands
	of commercial television and film have led to the propaganda of many
	myths and misconceptions about labor and birth. Women and girls raised
	on this sort of thing without a source of more accurate knowledge learn
	to equate labor pain with danger." These fictional representations of
	birth act as filler for the firsthand experiences women are denied the
	opportunity to accumulate. This results in women viewing labor pain as a
	negative element, rather than accepting it as a guide to optimal
	positioning and a vital element in the physiological feedback that
	releases additional endorphins and oxytocin, as the body requires. <br />
	<br />
	Even television programs that claim to present the reality of the
	birthing process censor the natural event of vaginal birth. Women never
	see the amazing natural ability of the vagina to stretch and open and
	are instead left with cliche fears about squeezing watermelons through
	lemons. Familiarity with the birthing process would allow women to
	learn, through personal experience, that birth is a normal event that
	their bodies are naturally capable of carrying out. In the culturally
	sanctioned absence of such personal experience, media presentations that
	highlight the natural beauty of birth would serve as a vital step toward
	relieving the fears harbored by many women.

	<h2>Research To Remember</h2>
	About 500 women participated in a study to determine the incidence of
	acute trauma symptoms and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that
	resulted from their labor and birth experiences. They were interviewed
	in their third trimester and then at 4-6 weeks postpartum, with a focus
	on medical and midwifery management of the birth, their perceptions of
	their care during the birth and the presence of trauma symptoms. 
	<br />
	The researchers found that one third of the women had experienced a
	traumatic birthing event and had at least three symptoms of trauma,
	while 5.6% met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. A high level of obstetric
	intervention during childbirth, along with a perception that intrapartum
	care was inadequate, was more likely to be associated with development
	of acute trauma symptoms.

	<b>Think About It</b> 
	"In light of studies... that link use of drugs in
	labor with increased risk of addiction in adult offspring, it is
	interesting to note that an upsurge in cocaine addiction began around 20
	years after the introduction of epidural drugs, all of which contain
	cocaine derivatives."
