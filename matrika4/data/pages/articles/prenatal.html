            <br />
            While I fully support the philosophy that the baby and mother are 
            physiologically one being, there are still two consciousnesses to 
            consider when you provide care. As the baby moves from the spiritual 
            world into its physical body it becomes more and more aware of external 
            influences as the pregnancy advances. This is reflected by the baby's 
            increasing ability to see, hear and respond to outside stimuli. As 
            the midwife, you will be one of the people with whom the baby will 
            develop a consistent relationship prior to birth.</font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From the onset 
            of care, whenever I come into contact with the baby, I talk to
            the baby about what I am doing, how it is growing, what position it 
            needs to be
            in, etc. I give the baby positive verbal feedback to get it used to 
            the sound of
            my voice, to let it know what is happening, and so that, in the event 
            of a
            problem during the birth, we have already established a relationship. 
            This lets
            the baby know that such activities as palpation and listening for 
            heart tones
            are not just random pokes from the big world outside but are due to 
            the care and
            interest of a particular individual. If a problem arises during prenatal 
            care, I
            tell the baby what is needed (for example, it is easiest to come out 
            head
            first). If the baby won't cooperate, I consider that the baby may 
            be trying to
            tell me something and proceed from there (perhaps the cord is around 
            the neck,
            making it, in fact, easier to be breech).</font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have found 
            that it sets up a psychic connection with the baby to relate to it
            as a sentient and sensitive being right from the start. I feel much 
            more in tune
            throughout the pregnancy, the labor and the birth and have had experiences 
            that
            bear this out. Try it and explore your own experiences in this light.</font></p>
