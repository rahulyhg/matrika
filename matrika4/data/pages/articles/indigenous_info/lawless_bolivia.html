<h2>Abstract:</h2>
This paper discusses theoretical and political tensions in trying to
challenge maternal health policymaking in Bolivia to fully incorporate
indigenous Andean birth technologies and indigenous practitioners and to
support the work of improving professional practices around childbirth
in order to help bring down the rates of maternal mortality in a country
where healthcare resources are severely limited.<br />
<h2>Maternal Mortality in the Aymara Population of Highland Bolivia</h2>
The Andean region, together with Mesoamerica, is one of two great
â€œmacro-ethniasâ€� of the Americas where 80% of the indigenous population
live. Two languages dominate the Andes, Quechua (with 12 million
speakers) and Aymara (with 3 million). In the case of Bolivia, according
to conservative estimates (Ruhlen, 1987), the indigenous population is
59.2% of the total, or 76.4%, according to more generous ones (CEPAL).
In the latter case, 25% of the national population is held to be Aymara
speakers (1.6 million), 30% are Quechua speakers (2.5 million) and those
from other Andean groups, and the rest a combination of GuaranÃ­ (10%)
and other diverse Amazonian groups (10%), and the mestizo-criollo
groups, who live mainly in the urban centres (15%). The cities of La Paz
and El Alto de La Paz have a combined total of 47.6% of Aymara speakers
according to the 1992 Census (AlbÃ³, 1995).<br />
<br />
However, while the majority of Boliviaâ€™s population is indigenous, only
2% of those who administer the country come from these groups, making
them a â€œpowerless majorityâ€�. In spite of having approved various laws
and legal instruments in the last decade to remedy this situation, the
perpetuation of this inequality of opportunities for indigenous peoples
(and the educational and health possibilities for overcoming them)
underlies the structural problems that face the country at present, and
which effect these people most heavily. <br />
<br />
One of these structural problems is maternal mortality. Bolivia has the
highest rate of maternal mortality on the Latin American mainland,
signifying in practice some 24% of the total deaths of women of
reproductive age. According to the official census statistics, analyzed
by the National Committee for Safe Motherhood in 2000, the maternal
mortality rate currently stands at an average of 390 deaths per 100,000
births for the country as a whole, but with wide regional variation.
Even these figures are open to question, and the real incidence of
maternal death may be much higher. Hospital deaths are not always
reported adequately (Medicon, 1994), there are family factors of shame
and guilt which hide the real facts, there are numerous clandestine
cemeteries in cities, and in rural areas there are still no formal
procedures for reporting such deaths. In addition, the World Bank (1999)
estimates that Bolivian statistics as a whole may have an error of some
80%, and that they are more directed towards achieving estimated
national projections, than reflecting reality.<br />
<br />
Taken as a whole, Boliviaâ€™s three broad geographical regions: <i>altiplano</i>
or Highlands, <i>valle</i> or Valley region, and <i>llano</i> or
Lowlands, show wide regional differences. The average mortality rate for
the Highland region of La Paz, Oruro and PotosÃ­, is 591 maternal deaths
per 100,000 live births, more than double that of the Lowlands, where
the rate is 166 per 100,000 births. In the Aymara speaking heartland of
the department of La Paz, the regional average is 429 maternal deaths
per 100,000 live births, and in some rural Aymara speaking provinces of
La Paz (Inquisivi, Larecaja, Pacajes, MuÃ±ecas, Aroma) this figure rises
to 887. Even in Murillo province, where the Aymara-speaking city of El
Alto is situated, there are 350 maternal deaths for every 100,000
births. The combined effect of these regional variations is to give a
rate for some rural Highland areas of 929 maternal deaths for every
100,000 live births (INE, 1994). Of these, 50% are deaths in childbirth,
rather than in pregnancy or induced abortions. <br />
<br />
The overall patterns and statistics of maternal mortality show that the
groups most affected are Aymara speaking populations, whether in rural
or urban areas, making maternal mortality in Bolivia a political
question and one of gender relations. Although many official
interventions in this problem are achieving results in the long term,
the overall percentage of young women of reproductive age is increasing,
so the overall number of maternal deaths is still increasing. <br />
<h2>Rethinking Models of Maternal Health in the 21st Century</h2>
This current state of maternal health in Highland Bolivia must be
understood in the context of the current world map, where the rich-poor
gap has increased as the agendas of trade liberalization have been
locked into place with the World Trade Organization (see for example
Rogers, 2000). Neo-liberal free-trade regimes have led to a persistent
upward transfer of wealth since the 1980s. This has meant that the poor
to poorest countries, including Bolivia, are forced to deal with the
combined effects of life-threatening environmental degradation, debt
burdens, and trade sanctions from rich world countries. As a result,
they are developing very slowly or not at all, while the vast majority
of the population is unable to meet their basic needs in food, water,
housing, good health, community and stability, and safe birth. In
reality, the deepening endemic poverty for billions of ordinary people
has resulted in much more precarious conditions for pregnant women.<br />
<br />
In order to combat these problems, many Latin American governments,
including Bolivia, have sought since the 1980s to provide formal
biomedical health care, based on Western hospital systems, as an
important element to secure better maternal health, with their
initiatives following guidelines of the international programs of Safe
Motherhood. However, increasingly unsecured social and economic
conditions make it hard for this model to work with any consistent
success in dealing with complicated health problems. The biomedical
knowledges on which this model is based are very potent, but they do not
transfer easily. The â€˜fitâ€™ between bodies and scientific technological
medicine that appears so logical in systems of childbirth management in
highly developed countries do not necessarily have the same outcomes
elsewhere. For example, in New Caledonia, where modern biomedical
facilities have been built with the aid of French subsidies, maternal
mortality rates remain disturbingly high, when compared with neighboring
states of far less wealthy communities (Jolly, 2002).<br />
<br />
In addition, it is necessary to consider how these expert biomedical
knowledges are created, legitimated and transferred, and what elements
are neglected in these processes. Many studies have shown that distinct
cultures perceive and feel bodies differently. For example, in the
Andes, the body is perceived as flexible, like a weaving. Traditional
birth practices of finger pressure and massage depend on this flexible
body. The <i>manteo</i>, where the womanâ€™s body is shaken gently with a
woven cloth, and the technique of â€œmaking the woman runâ€� (jalayaÃ±a in
Aymara), whereby babies are repositioned in the vertical axis by the
gradual movements of a cloth tied around the womenâ€™s waist, or by
tossing the women in a blanket or a woven poncho, also appeal to this
body of Andean knowledge. So do Andean techniques of external version in
cases of malpresentation of the baby, when the women is placed on all
fours, in order to achieve the widest cervical opening and so allow
local health experts to adjust the babyâ€™s position (Arnold and Yapita
with Tito, 1999).<br />
<br />
In contrast, medical training in Bolivia, as elsewhere, tends to be done
on inflexible bodies, mainly cadavers. This is because the Western
biomedical model favored in Bolivian medical schools â€˜perceivesâ€™ the
body as something that â€˜strongâ€™ technologies can always fix, usually by
overcoming or bypassing what are perceived as â€˜faultyâ€™ bodily processes
(Murphy-Lawless, 1998a and b). Yet the strong technologies, and the
equipment and the training that accompanies them, are far less available
or even sustainable in impoverished countries such as Bolivia. Here, as
Jolly has shown, health systems often â€˜mimicâ€™ these Western models, but
they cannot replicate them (Jolly, 2002: 11). <br />
<br />
At the same time, local knowledges and Andean technologies which may not
have the same range of efficacy or evaluated outcomes, and that appear
far less deterministic, may nevertheless provide elements of safety and
well-being in the difficult circumstances of giving birth. Just as the
body is plastic and flexible, so models based on flexibility,
plasticity, and heterodoxy, are necessary to challenge current official
Bolivian policies about childbirth, safety and well-being, and provide
ways of rethinking these criteria.<br />
<br />
<h2>The Causes of Maternal Mortality: Statistics and Reality</h2>
The distribution of causes of maternal mortality, by percentage,
according to official statistics, is hemorrhage (53.7%), abortion
(14.3%), infection (9.0%), eclampsia (9.0%), obstructed birth (4.5%) and
others (10.5%) (<i>ComitÃ© por una Maternidad Segura</i>, 2000). In
addition, according to data from 1996, the 53.7% of maternal deaths of
hemorrhage in La Paz were provoked by a retained placenta. <br />
<br />
But whereas official statistics persuade us that maternal death is
determined by the risk of retained placenta, in practice maternal deaths
occur when there is an inadequate infrastructure (roads, ambulance,
trained medical and paramedical personnel, and safe supplies of drugs
and blood) to deal with obstetric risks such as retained placenta,
should they arise. And there is the added lack of confidence of
indigenous populations that their medical needs will be met, even if
they travel long distances, in an atmosphere of wide discrimination
against the majority population.<br />
<br />
Moreover, in practice, the combination of different populations in the
Bolivian highlands generates dual health systems: the biomedical or
official health system, and an Andean health system that operates more
clandestinely. General discrimination on the part of many medical staff
against Aymara speaking women lowers their uptake of official health
services, the Aymara population preferring to use their own medical
practices and practitioners in a domestic atmosphere of confidence and
family members.<br />
<br />
In addition, maternal mortality among this population is compounded by
factors such as high fertility, the gradual loss of control over
demographic processes in rural populations, through forced medical
interventions (vaccination programs), without a wider contextualization
of their results, little access to, and use of reliable methods of
family planning, general low indices of womenâ€™s health, particularly in
rural areas, and a general <i>machismo</i> in the male population,
generated in part from growing economic uncertainty.<br />
<br />
<h2>Who Attends Births in the Bolivian Highlands, and How?</h2>
In the context of the alarming statistics of maternal mortality, that
indicate that 80% of maternal deaths occur in home births attended by
family members and â€œtraditional birth attendantsâ€� (TBAs), official
Bolivian health policy has been to increase the number of institutional
births and the number of births attended by what are called â€œtrained
personnelâ€�. However, this in turn has provoked other problems that
damage indigenous womenâ€™s health.<br />
<br />
According to the data collected by REBOHUPAN (The Bolivian Network for
the Humanization of Childbirth), 56.25% of births in the 3 years before
the ENDSA report of 1998 were attended by trained health personnel, but
with a wide difference between rural and urban areas and by region.<br />
<br />
Recent figures show a relatively low incidence of attendance by
traditional midwives as a whole (7.40% as a national average) and a
decreasing importance of these practitioners (from 10.35% in 1994) in
favor of attendance by medical personnel and family members. But, in
practice, other factors must be taken into account. For example, studies
have shown that as high as 80% of first births in rural areas are
attended by TBAs, called in Bolivia â€œtraditionalâ€� or â€œempiricalâ€�
midwives (Arnold, Yapita and others, 2002), and that then it is common
practice for later births to be attended by family members (as an
average of 44.20% in the Highland region), according to the womanâ€™s
preferences. This indicates a substantial difference between learning
patterns, engaged with Andean ideologies of childbirth, for first
births, and general patterns of practice, that such broad statistics
cannot reveal easily. Also, attendance by medical personnel tends to be
very uneven. In general, hospital births are attended by student
doctors, often without adequate supervision.<br />
<br />
Another factor which affects the take-up of hospital births for Aymara
women is the increasing tendency for medical intervention to promote
Cesarean section over vaginal births. For rural Aymara women who work
the land, carrying heavy loads, to have their body â€œcutâ€� in childbirth
is to â€œloseâ€� her bodyâ€™s labor power. They have no time to recover slowly
from this operation, as middle-class women do, and Cesarean scars do not
heal easily when they return to their daily activities of running
households and farms almost immediately after birth. ILCA found that the
Dutch Hospital in El Alto reached a figure of 26% of Cesareans in 1998,
despite their discourse about birth attendance by husbands and midwives
(Arnold and Murphy-Lawless, with Yapita and others, 2001). In this
context, it is not surprising that the rising incidence of Cesareans in
Bolivia is related to gender, class and ethnic questions, since the
majority of doctors who tend to prefer this technique of childbirth are
male, middle class, and white, and their â€œtarget practiceâ€� is on
indigenous womenâ€™s bodies (CalderÃ³n C., 2000).<br />
<br />
<h2>Official Maternal Health Policy in Bolivia</h2>
As stated above, Safe Motherhood initiatives were gradually applied to
national health policies in Bolivia, but without taking into account the
needs of its populations, above all indigenous ones. For example, the
publication of <i>Plan Vida</i>, in 1994, put into action a national
health plan of the increasing institutionalization of childbirth as a
means to reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. The plan
from 1994-7 was to reduce the percentage of home births from 60% to 40%,
and to ensure that 20% of home births would be attended by trained
personnel by 1997. Then, in September 1999, a new series of goals were
implemented, this time to increase to 65% the attendance of all births
in Bolivia by trained personal by the year 2002. <br />
<br />
Official policies have also attempted to reduce maternal mortality and
morbidity by reducing the overall rate of fecundity through increased
access to Family Planning methods, by increasing the national coverage
of prenatal care, and developing a system of Basic Health Security (<i>Seguridad
BÃ¡sica de Salud</i>) that offers free institutional birth (apart from some
medical costs). They have persuaded TBAs to refer pregnant women,
especially those thought to be at risk, to Health Centers, and have
introduced new financial incentives for TBAs (and other Andean medical
experts) under the new Indigenous Health Security scheme to do so<br />
<br />
Other current official targets of the Safe Motherhood program are to
promote basic health safety in departmental health services, to
systematize and incorporate the results of ethnographic studies of
maternal health into the official health system and to increase the
knowledge of maternal health among family members, so that they may
improve decision-making in cases of risk. There are also plans to
organize obstetrical networks in collaboration with municipalities, and
in conjunction with social and transporting networks, to improve systems
of referral in cases of emergency, and to help in the detection and
resolution of obstetrical emergencies and reduction of maternal death in
home births attended by trained personnel and the development of other
maternal and neonatal health components as a part of the National
Program in Sexual and Reproductive Health.<br />
<br />
However, in practice, in order to achieve the national aims of
increasing the attendance of childbirth by trained personnel, and
redirecting official policy towards institutional births, it has been
necessary to adjust the definition of â€œtrained personalâ€�, and
dramatically reduce their period of training. This affected, in
particular, the training of nurses, a factor that might well have
aggravated the risk of maternal death for indigenous rural populations.
International directives throughout the past 20 years have also affected
the nature and degree of incorporation of TBAs into the formal health
system. In the 1970s, the WHO program still gave some autonomy to TBAs,
although in the following decades they aimed to combine the two medical
systems (traditional and official) into one. This is despite a number of
anthropological and medical studies (Jordan, 1989; Cao, 1998; Quiroz,
2002) that showed why the earlier training systems for indigenous
midwives failed, and how they might have been improved. Their criticisms
span from the epistemological questions of medical authority and
knowledges, to questions of learning (whether it should be theory or
practice-based), the quality and cultural suitability of teaching
materials, and the lack of intercultural approaches in earlier courses.<br />
<br />
So, in practice, indigenous TBAs have been excluded officially from
further training possibilities, while conventional western-style medical
courses have been streamlined to perhaps dangerous limits. There was
also a parallel rethinking of what â€œtrained personnelâ€� in obstetrical
emergencies might mean, the new definitions underlining the fact that
such personnel, besides having a biomedical training, should have access
to an emergency infrastructure of radio, roads and ambulances, unlike
their TBA counterparts. <br />
<br />
<h2>Toward the Humanization of Birth in Bolivia</h2>
While Latin American countries such as Bolivia seek modernization
through greater medical and technological intervention in childbirth,
many of their worldwide counterparts have been seeking the
de-medicalization and de-technologizing of birth, as a necessary step in
order to achieve greater humanization of birth. This has sometimes
involved re-learning the beneficial practices of indigenous midwives,
which often follow closely many of the WHO guidelines for normal birth
(1996, 1997).<br />
<br />
While there has been interest in â€œhumanizingâ€� birth in Bolivia since
about 1986, especially by the MEDICON group, their sources of
inspiration tended to come from initiatives outside their borders,
rather than looking to indigenous Andean practices of birth. For
example, <i>Plan Vida</i> (Bolivian Ministry of Health, 1994), and
various other official documents, recommended a series of changes in
medical practice, including the adoption of the vertical or sitting
position for birth, improved communication with the women in labor,
abandoning the practices of tricotomy and episiotomy, giving liquids,
and avoiding the unnecessary use of oxytocins, without specifying that
these approaches are all inherent in indigenous Andean practices of
childbirth.<br />
<br />
In the 1990s, various groups from civil societies, especially those
working with rural Aymara speaking women and urban migrants, began to
demand â€œa different treatmentâ€� in childbirth, that besides humanizing
birth also took account of different cultural practices (TAHIPAMU, 1994;
Arnold and Yapita, 1994, 1996, etc.). This led to the formation of
various official committees and commissions in the following years,
dedicated to the â€œcultural adaptationâ€� of the official health sector
towards what were viewed as Andean cultural norms. For example, the US
financed NGO, Mothercare, began to implement a series of â€œAndean norms
in childbirthâ€�, taken from an ILCA report in 1994 (Arnold and
Murphy-Lawless, with Yapita and others, 2001: 61). These included the
adoption of the vertical or sitting position, keeping the woman in labor
woman warm, ensuring her privacy, ensuring the presence of a husband,
midwife, or some other family member, giving due importance to the
treatment of the placenta and its return to the mother if she wished.<br />
<br />
Another trend of thought in Bolivia, argued that what had been called
until now â€œAndean cultural normsâ€� in the humanization of childbirth,
were in many cases norms that applied to all women, regardless of their
ethnic and cultural backgrounds (Arnold and Murphy-Lawless, with Yapita
and others, 2002). This trend compared many Andean birth practices to
the â€œSocial Model of Birthâ€� proposed by Marsden Wagner (1994), and the
â€œPhysiologial Model of Birthâ€� proposed by the professional midwife,
Cecily Begley (1991), backed by the WHO 1996 <i>Guide for Normal
Birth</i>. Key medical issues in these alternative models of childbirth
focus on the management of the umbilical cord (with late cord cutting)
and the placenta, as crucial issues for reducing the incidence of
hemorrhage and retained placenta, the main causes of maternal mortality
in childbirth. In particular, the ILCA study of 1998-9 showed the
emphasis amongst indigenous midwives on protective practices in relation
to the safe delivery of the placenta, the data indicating clear
understandings about the need for practices to reduce the risk of
serious maternal illness stemming from retained placenta and postpartum
hemorrhage (Arnold and Murphy-Lawless, with Yapita and others, 2001).<br />
<br />
This train of argument established that many beneficial Andean practices
are in line with these alternative models of childbirth, and that
instead of â€œcultural adaptationâ€� of official health practices, rather a
serious medical dialogue between alternative medical systems (the
biomedical and the Andean), should begin. For example, the following
practices, which are central to care given by indigenous midwives in
Bolivia, were deemed â€œdemonstrably useful practicesâ€� by the WHO:
empathic support by caregivers during labor and birth, respecting the
womanâ€™s choice of companions during labor and birth, offering oral
fluids during labor and delivery, non-invasive, non-pharmacological
methods of pain relief during labor such as massage and relaxation
techniques, freedom in position and movement throughout labor, and the
encouragement of a non-supine position during labor (WHO, 1996).<br />
<br />
When the Social Model of birth, concentrating on these practices and on
continuity of care (the woman having the same midwife caregiver
throughout labor), was evaluated, and compared with conventional
obstetric care, seven randomized controlled trials demonstrated
statistically proven better birth outcomes. Reported results from these
studies conducted in hospital settings included shorter, less painful
labors; less likelihood of intrapartum analgesia; less likelihood of
operative vaginal delivery; and, for babies, better Apgar scores at five
minutes (WHO, 1997). This thesis was the basis for the formation of the
Latin American Childbirth Network (RELACAHUPAN) and its Bolivian
counterpart (REBOHUPAN) as a result of a Workshop held in the Fortaleza
Conference on Humanized Birth, held in Brazil in November 2000.<br />
<br />
Support for the humanization of birth has also come from various
pressure groups in civil society, whether through their written
initiatives on how to achieve this (Ten Steps of the Mother-Friendly
Childbirth Initiative, <i>la Iniciative para un parto Respetuoso con
la Madre de</i> CIMS), their demands for greater womenâ€™s rights in
childbirth (<i>Carta de los Derechos de la Pacientes Embarazadas</i>),
or greater womenâ€™s autonomy, for example through her autodiagnosis of
her state of health during the perinatal period (<i>Responsabilidades
de la Paciente Embarazada</i>). <br />
<br />
Similar tendencies have occurred with regard to the categories of
obstetrical risk. While older directives proposed a broad set of 24
categories, some of which alluded directly to the high risk category of
â€œilliterate indigenous women,â€� there have since been attempts to bridge
the biomedical and Andean categories of risk in more constructive ways,
in order to create a more constructive medical dialogue (see for example
Santa MarÃ­a, 2002). However, it is evident that any constructive medical
dialogue in the future will have to address the question of Bolivian
medical training, especially in obstetrics, that still tends to be
geared towards past biomedical models. <br />
<br />
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
The bettering of maternal health in Bolivia demands a broad strategy of
interventions in order to achieve a series of different, but related
aims. These include the lowering of the high incidence of maternal (and
infant) mortality, particularly in indigenous Aymara and Quechua
speaking highland populations, the sustaining of a diversity of
approaches to protect womenâ€™s safety in childbirth, in a context of
multilinguism and pluriculturality, and the humanizing of childbirth and
infancy in the official health services to improve quality and take-up,
when necessary. <br />
<br />
The overall challenge is to reduce maternal (and infant) mortality,
while at the same time humanizing childbirth and early infancy. This
means introducing extensive reforms in medical training, and a
reinstated program of midwifery training which incorporates both
western-style midwifery training and the support of training for
indigenous midwifery. A new generation of Midwifery Schools should be
sited in strategic areas, for example in the Aymara-speaking heartland
of El Alto of La Paz, and backed by new curricular developments based in
the Social and Physiological Models of Birth, with new teaching
materials and teaching models, and new initiatives in birthing rooms,
with regionally sensitive designs in equipment. Possible students in
these new Midwifery Schools are present auxiliary nurses seeking a
speciality, and a new generation of young midwives from rural areas who
can adapt to new teaching models. The latter might also be aided by
providing a system of grants to rural communities that will allow them
to identify young people who may benefit from such courses, in order to
better serve their communities. <br />
<br />
At the rural and periurban levels, it is necessary to conform adequate
referral networks, and additional vigilance on the way existing services
are used, and emergency facilities operate, and the way that existing
funds are spent. All of this means a determined collaboration with
Aymara populations, so that the currently high figures of maternal
mortality can really be reduced.<br />
