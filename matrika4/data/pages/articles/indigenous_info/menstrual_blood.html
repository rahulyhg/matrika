	The couple I stayed with during fieldwork in Bengal sing and beg for a
	living. Bringing their instruments and begging bags, they rise at dawn
	and follow the road leading out of their village. They continue walking
	until they reach the station. They always sing on the same train, a
	local train, full of people taking produce to the market. They prefer
	this local train, since they know the passengers. The woman, Tara, has
	been singing on the same train since she was a little girl.<br />
	<br />
	She is now in her early thirties. Her husband is ten years older. And
	though their caste identity is that of untouchable leatherworkers, they
	also term themselves Vaishnava Baul, which entails that they are orange
	clad mendicants who beg for alms while singing. Some songs are about
	Radha and Krishna. Others address notions of procreative seed, thought
	to be present in bodily fluids including menstrual blood. Rivers rising
	once a month refer to a womanâ€™s monthly flow. A flower blooming after
	twelve years signifies a young girl starting to menstruate. To drink the
	honey from the flower, or to go swimming in the river is to ingest a
	womanâ€™s flow in order to be nourished, a process, which is linked to
	love. <br />
	<br />
	<h2>Theoretical Overview</h2>
	Previous accounts have tended to describe Vaishnava Baul renouncers as a
	separate Tantric sect, whose members bear little in common with ordinary
	villagers. In keeping with this postulate, ideas about menstrual blood
	have been interpreted as inversions of orthodox norms and practices,
	where a womanâ€™s monthly flow is thought to be polluting. In contrast to
	such views, I argue that the traits attributed to this substance are
	ambiguous, both multiple and inconsistent. For while menstrual blood is
	regarded as harmful and impure, it is also a source of fertility and
	nourishment. Following Marriott (1976), Daniel (1984) and Trawick
	(1990), my contention is that the fluid is valued, yet also shunned, for
	it collapses the boundaries of self and others, forging ties resembling
	those between a mother and her offspring or a deity and devotees. Thus,
	rather than positing a singular model for understanding the traits of
	menstrual blood, I suggest, following Strauss and Quinn, that salient
	cultural themes, such as fertility and pollution, are organized by
	different mental models, also known as schemas. These schemas overlap,
	which means that they often mediate cultural concerns, which may seem
	disparate (Strauss & Quinn 1997: 139, 167). What follows is an attempt
	to iterate the particular manner in which Tara and her husband described
	this female substance. As I hope to show, ideas voiced are grounded in
	popular Hindu cosmology and as such they resonate with notions held by
	non-renouncers too. <br />
	<br />
	<h2>Initiation</h2>
	Tara was fifteen years old when she and her mother became renouncers.
	During the ceremony, both received new orange saris and a white strip of
	cotton cloth wound around their heads, in which the colors signified the
	red and white seed secreted by a woman. Tara likened the ceremony to a
	birth. â€œThis is the reason why our clothes were new and it is also the
	reason why we cut our hair. A newborn baby has no hair. Everything is
	new.â€� <br />
	<br />
	Apart from likening the ceremony to a birth, Tara also compared it to
	the Muslim act of circumcision and to the rite a Brahman boy goes
	through when receiving a sacred thread, though she added that Vaishnavas
	differ in important ways. Women may go through with the ceremony. It is
	not a rite reserved for males. She went on to point out that truth about
	the seed inherent in this female substance was first divulged by
	Krishna, then preserved by gurus who transmit it to their adepts. To
	learn about its properties, I myself went through a ceremony of
	initiation, where after Tara and her husband took on the job of teaching
	me the knowledge they had gained.<br />
	<br />
	<h2>Seed</h2>
	Procreative seed, said Tara, stems from the head, where it takes the
	shape of a pond, giving rise to a river, flowing through the body. The
	river, she said, is the true (ashal) river Ganga, bearing the same power
	in concentrated form. Although all people possess this fertile
	seed-river, ordinary men and women who do not realize its traits lose it
	when they procreate for seed is spent when creating a child. By
	contrast, those who know its qualities do their utmost to retain it. As
	a result, they do not wilt and shrivel up, but stay vigorous and juicy.
	Such people have bodies with flowers sprouting in different places.
	There is a flower at the base of the spinal chord, another in the
	genital region and one beneath the navel. There is a flower in the chest
	as well as one between the eyes. But at the top most part of the head,
	there is a forest of flowers growing in a pond comprised of procreative
	seed. In women the seed appears in menstrual blood emerging from the
	genital region on a monthly basis. <br />
	<br />
	A womanâ€™s monthly flow is always viewed as potent. Yet the first flow a
	woman elicits is considered to be the most potent fluid of all. Tara
	said she was twelve years old when she got her period. She told her
	mother, who told her father. And her father went to their family guru,
	to tell him what had happened. Their guru then invited other sadhus to
	his ashram for the forthcoming event to ingest the fluid. â€œGreat sadhus
	gathered together to partake in the new fluid,â€� said Tara calling the
	fluid <i>rup</i>. â€œIt is a very good thing. If my son had been a girl,â€�
	she added, â€œgreat sadhus would come to my house, asking me to invite
	them. For few people manage to obtain it.â€�<br />
	<br />
	Taraâ€™s father had prepared himself ahead of time. He purchased a piece
	of cotton cloth at the market so that she could wear it when her <i>rup</i>
	appeared. After this, he gave the cloth bearing the <i>rup</i> to the
	family guru. Upon receiving it, the guru stored the cloth away. The
	bloodstain dried and the cloth hardened. A month went by while waiting
	for the other sadhus to appear. When they finally gathered together, her
	guru rinsed the cloth in water. Then he cooled the fluid down, by
	soaking it in four different substances. These were cowâ€™s milk, coconut
	juice, camphor, and palm juice. He also added white sugar, to sweeten
	the ingredients. Tara said, â€œthe mixture of red <i>rup</i> and white
	milk yielded a syrupy substance, bearing the color pink. Milk,â€� she
	mused, â€œis very strange. It draws the red <i>rup</i> out of the cloth,
	so that the cloth turns white again.â€� She went on to tell me that when
	the different ingredients had merged, the coconut shell containing the
	fluid was passed around to those present, so that each one, including
	her self could have a sip. <br />
	<br />
	Her husband, who was listening and who had never had the opportunity to
	drink a womanâ€™s first flow, exclaimed that Tara had been fortunate. â€œIt
	makes you healthyâ€� he said, adding that the liquid is also beautiful.
	â€œAll the colors of the river Ganga are present in the fluid. The play of
	colors signifies the love play (<i>lila</i>), taking place between the
	deities Radha and Krishna.â€� He also spoke of the festival of colors
	known as Holi, during which villagers throw colored water on each other.
	Radha and Krishna instigated this ceremony, when they smeared each other
	with Radhaâ€™s first, colorful, watery, seed.<br />
	<br />
	<h2>Other Types of Seed</h2>
	Aside from menstrual blood however, other fluids too have seed. There is
	seed in urine, feces, tears and saliva, sweat as well as motherâ€™s milk.
	Plants, animals and insects â€“ everything has seed. There is seed in fire
	and water â€“ in sound as well as smell. In other words, entities, which
	seem intangible, are actually substantial. Seed is a vivifying
	substance, which animates the body. Without seed there is no life.<br />
	<br />
	This is why ingesting seed invigorates the body. When speaking of this
	practice, Tara said â€œif you put feces in the ground the plants and
	vegetables grow healthy. If you put it in your body â€“ by drinking it or
	smearing the substance onto to your skin â€“ your body too grows healthy.â€�
	In Tara and her husbandâ€™s view, life then is a process, where seed
	incessantly moves about, like a woman emitting menstrual blood on a
	regular basis.<br />
	<br />
	Still, a newborn baby has a weak seed-substance. The seed in food must
	nourish the seed that they embody. It is only when children reach the
	age of twelve, that the seed they have is properly developed. At that
	age they become shy, reflective and self-conscious, and spend a lot time
	gazing at their image in the mirror. Tara would sometimes make fun of
	her son, laugh at him for bathing naked, not covering up his genitals.
	â€�Lookâ€�, she said, â€�heâ€™s not shy, still stupid. No intelligence,â€�
	implying that her son had not acquired sufficient quantities of seed. <br />
	<br />
	A growth of seed makes you intelligent, but you must be able to control
	it. It should be retained or ingested, so that it does not go to waste.
	Ordinary people cannot do this. They let it fall and circulate. Only
	holy men and women have powers of control. (Many sadhus do have
	children, including Tara and her husband, but this is because retaining
	seed is difficult.) Great sadhus I was told, can sweat, breathe and
	urinate without emitting seed. Still, if they choose to do so, they will
	transmit a portion (usually in the form of urine or saliva), so that
	their adepts are regenerated. As I will show below, the act of singing
	has a similar effect, for the power of seed is transmitted to others in
	the form of music. <br />
	<br />
	<h2>Thermodynamic Traits of Seed and its Relationship to Music</h2>
	During the time I spent with them, Tara and her husband did not alter
	their begging patterns. They would leave their house at dawn to beg by
	means of singing, and return at noon or afternoon. When coming home,
	both felt faint. I would fan them and give them water to drink while
	they were recuperating. <br />
	<br />
	At first I thought it strange that they became so weak, but Tara
	explained that this was because of their singing practices. A song she
	said contains a thing (<i>jinish</i>), which is endowed with a life (<i>jiban</i>)
	or life force (<i>pran</i>). To stay alive however, the song must be
	performed in a shrill and piercing manner. By way of illustration she
	made a zig-zag pattern in my notebook, saying that the notes should be
	like little drops of dew. The opposite way of singing is described as
	fat. A person with a voice like that cannot hold and slide the notes,
	and so the life it bears will die. People prefer to listen to women
	since their voices are usually thinner and sweeter, but men may attain a
	sharp voice by bending the notes in an undulating fashion. And providing
	the passengers listen, the songs will nourish and empower them.<br />
	<br />
	But Tara and her husband are faced with a problem. Since their own power
	is diminished, their balance is disrupted. As a result they are
	susceptible to external forces. Both are affected by the heating powers
	of the sun, or the cold stemming from the rain. If the sun attacked
	them, they would suffer dizzy spells and complain of gases erupting,
	which would rise to the head where they might explode. If assaulted by
	the cold, they would experience fevers; their eyes would be glazed and
	they started to cough. After a while, they would eat. <br />
	<br />
	To Tara and her husband as to other villagers, food was a major remedy
	when feeling out of sorts. Whenever they were â€œhotâ€� they sought to alter
	their condition by ingesting food classified as â€œcold.â€� If the opposite
	was true, â€œhotâ€� food would be ingested such as onion, meat and garlic.
	In other words, â€œhotâ€� and â€œcoldâ€� substances must be in proportion. (See
	Jeffery & Jeffery 1996: 52, 95, Mines 1994: 7, Daniel 1984: 236, for
	similar ideas pertaining to food held by non-renouncers.)<br />
	<br />
	In view of these circumstances, ingesting seed in menstrual blood and
	other bodily emissions was not a viable alternative. Doing so, they
	said, would be like ingesting poison. Since Tara and her husband must
	leave their house on a daily basis to go singing on the trains so as to
	collect sufficient money. And since singing weakens them, they cannot
	always adhere to the ideal, which posits that they manage on a cooling
	diet, supplemented by â€œhotâ€� seed stemming from bodily emissions. They
	need the less potent seed in eggs, meat and garlic (classified as â€œhotâ€�
	though not as â€œhotâ€� as seed from bodily secretions), in order to get by.
	<br />
	<br />
	Though I have not discussed aspects of pollution in the above, these
	ideas also enter into daily interactions, such as when a woman is
	required to conceal her menstrual rags after she has washed them, (when
	hanging them up to dry). Or, when a person must refrain from tasting the
	food that he or she is cooking, so that their saliva will not
	contaminate what others will ingest. Or the rule, which posits that
	sadhus who are great should not absorb the fluids of lesser beings,
	since in doing so the boundaries of great and low (or self and others)
	are erased.<br />
	<br />
	Yet, in situations where nurture and relatedness are pivotal, erasing
	boundaries is a desired outcome. Pollution then, is not the overriding
	trait. Rather, the value attached to menstrual blood, is also linked to
	peopleâ€™s concerns with being loved and staying healthy, with what they
	eat as well as with the things that they secrete, with entities like
	sound and conditions of the weather. It is the life force inherent in
	all these substances, which makes them so alluring. Thus, although I was
	initially puzzled by the fact that things defined as pure were always
	spoken of as healthy, the underlying logic of such statements will be
	evident when cleanliness is viewed in terms of seed imbued with power,
	which if tempered will engender social and personal wellbeing. <br />
