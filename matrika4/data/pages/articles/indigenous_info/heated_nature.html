	<h1>Heated Nature of the Body During Birth</h1>
	<br />
	In Ayurveda, the vata principle is that of the subtle energy of movement
	in the body. Pitta is the energy of digestion and metabolism. Kapha is
	the energy of lubrication, structure and has the function of binding.
	Imbalance of these energies creates diseases or symptoms. The five
	mahabhoota (elements) are earth, air, fire, water and space. These five
	elements are grouped in combinations to produce the doshas or Ayurvedic
	categories:<br />
	<ol>
		<li>Vata = air and space</li>
		<li>Pitta = fire and water</li>
		<li>Kapha = water and earth</li>
	</ol>
	The overarching concept is that whatever principle is dominating must be
	pacified with a different principle. In Ayurveda, the signs of imbalance
	come first. The symptoms or the disease come later. Likewise dais, in
	their handling of the maternal body, use food, herbs and drinks in a
	prophylactic or preventative manner to balance these subtle energies <br />
	<br />
	The body is in a heated state during labour. Vata, in Ayurveda, is a
	combination of the principles of akash and vayu (space and movement).
	The process of birth has a lot to do with the air and space elements.
	During the opening of the body, vata works towards expulsion from the
	body. The task during labour is to facilitate that vata in the correct
	way. Heating herbs facilitate vata in working to expel. If the body is
	‘cooling off’, then heating and oily substances lubricate the passage,
	all passages. Medicated or otherwise oil is put on the birth canal to
	lubricate and hence facilitate the expulsion of the foetus.At this point
	vata, which is active, should be under control. Ghee ingested during
	last two or three months is strength building. and keeps the vata
	balanced in the body.<br />
	<br />
	During postpartum, after baby and placenta are out, food and drink are
	used to balance the doshas (vata, pitta and kapha). Gur, ajwain, gond
	are heating, cleansing and help manage the vata principle. Vata is
	active, expulsion having been active. The structures and systems in the
	body have been in a dynamic state of movement. The baby is out, and
	space, akash, and air (hava, vata) are present. To close the body down,
	bringing the body into balance, heating and oily(unctuous) substances
	are binding.<br />
	<br />
	The heating and cleansing functions of postpartum foods, drinks are
	therapeutic. Ghee, heating herbs, gond, sonth, have multiple functions
	of healing and curing. Construction workers, miners and housewives have
	traditionally imbibed gur as a cleansing agent, against the inhalation
	of dirt, coal or other particles, household dust. Postpartum women
	ingest gur concoctions to heat and cleanse the body of the ‘bad blood’,
	but also to rebalance the body. One Bihari nurse referred to these
	recipes as ‘desi antibiotics’.<br />
	<br />
	Whereas the focus of bio-medicine is the germ which causes the
	infection, the indigenous approach focuses on maintaining an environment
	in the body so that it is not a hospitable host to that which is not
	wanted. Although couched in terms of ‘bad blood’ the properties of these
	tonics provide a certain amount of protection against infection. <br />
	<br />
	Here there is an important distinction to be made between tonics and
	remedies. Dais give these heating and cleansing substances routinely to
	promote healthy bodily functioning postpartum. Undoubtedly they also
	serve a remedial function.<br />
	<br />
	Vata qualities: dryness, coldness, roughness, absence of oily or slimy
	qualities.<br />
	<br />
	Postpartum feeding of gruels use the pitta digestive function to provide
	warmth—heating foods. These are also important in subsiding the vata in
	the body. Rest is also important here.<br />
	<br />
	Massage and other manipulations postpartum are ways to close the space
	and deal with the movement of organs, bones, ligaments during
	labour—rebalancing and resituating the body. The head and body need to
	be protected from the cold outside. Mobility is restricted, rest is
	important. Good dais will observe the individual woman and her
	constitution (prakrit in Ayurveda) and treat her accordingly. If she saw
	a pitta type woman, she would go slow on the heating herbs, the labour
	would be progressing on its own. Dais can tailor their advice to each
	woman, not standardized care. For example if the woman is very weak
	postpartum, her digestive power is considered to be not strong, heavy
	foods would not be given. Even generally women’s digestive power is
	diminished during the birth process, so light foods requiring little
	digestive power would be given. Thus grain substances, which are kapha
	(heavy, cold, hard to digest) are given only after 2-3 days.<br />
