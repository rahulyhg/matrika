            Postdates, by itself, is not associated with poor pregnancy outcome. 
            Extreme postdates or postdates in conjunction with poor fetal growth 
            or developmental abnormalities does show an increased risk of stillbirth. 
            But if growth restriction and birth defects are removed, there is 
            no statistical increase in risk until a pregnancy reaches 42 weeks 
            and no significant risk until past 43 weeks. The primary &quot;evidence&quot; 
            of a sharp rise in stillbirth after 40 weeks - often misquoted as 
            &quot;double at 42 weeks and triple at 43 weeks&quot; - seems to come 
            from one study based on data collected in 1958 (1). ... Modern statistics 
            show an almost flat rate of stillbirth from 40 weeks to 42, with a 
            slight rise at 43 weeks (all numbers being close to 1/1000) (2).</font></font></p>

            There is a creeping overreaction in dealing with postdates pregnancies. 
            It is true that stillbirth and fetal distress rates rise more sharply 
            after 43 weeks, but it is also true that less than 10% of babies born 
            at 43 weeks suffer from postmaturity syndrome (more than 90% show 
            no signs). We should react to this rise by monitoring postdate pregnancies 
            carefully and inducing if problems arise. But the rise in problems 
            at 43 weeks does not imply a similar risk at 42 and 41 weeks. Postmaturity 
            syndrome is a continuum. It becomes more likely as weeks progress 
            past the due date but does not start on the due date. And the risks 
            must be compared to the risks of interventions. Induction is not risk 
            free. In addition to the risks of prematurity, induced labors have 
            higher rates of cesarean section, uterine rupture, cord prolapse, 
            meconium aspiration, fetal distress, neonatal jaundice, maternal hemorrhage 
            and even the rare but disastrous amniotic fluid embolism.</font></font></p>
