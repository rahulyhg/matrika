        Countries with some of the lowest perinatal mortality rates in the world 
        have caesarean rates under 10%. Clearly there is no justification in any 
        specific region to have more than 10-15% caesarean section births.&quot;

        &quot;The lack of concern among many obstetricians about the after-effects 
        of the rising caesarean rates may result from the fact that they spend 
        little time postnatally with women who had had caesarean sections and 
        are far removed from any physical or psychological ill-effects resulting 
        from the operation.&quot; </font><span class="smltxt4"> <font color="#996600">(Francome,

        &quot;Between 1970 and 1988, the American cesarean section rate rose from 
        5% of all births to nearly 25%. Few experts believe, and none have sound 
        data, that American mothers or infants are on the whole better off because 
        of this change. The occasional reports of complications, from delayed 
        cesarean section, such as uterine rupture or fetal distress, make more 
        headlines than the much more common, but harder-to-assess complications-pain, 
        anesthesia risks, post-operative infections, and blood loss, for example-from 
        hundreds of thousands of cesarean sections that simply did not need to 
        be done.&quot;</font> <span class="smltxt4"><font color="#996600">(National

        Continued increases in rates of obstetrical intervention are unlikely 
        to lead to improvements in birth outcome and may result in a higher incidence 
        of adverse outcome for mothers and their offspring. The risks associated 
        with caeserean section include: damage to uterine blood vessels; accidental 
        extension of the uterine incision; damage to the urinary bladder; anaesthesia 
        accidents; wound infections; maternal mortality. Depressed Apgar score; 
        higher rates of neonatal respiratory distress; shortened mean length gestation; 
        and higher perinatal mortality in subsequent pregnancies.&quot; </font><span class="smltxt4"><font color="#996600">(World

        J. Quilligan, MD, an editor of the American Journal of Obstetrics and

        have some committee that examines every cesarean section that is performed 
        in that hospital and determines whether it was indicated or not. If it 
        was not indicated, then the physician who performed the section should 
        be educated as to why it was not indicated.&quot; </font> <span class="smltxt4"><font color="#996600">(B.L.

        Luella Klein, MD, Past President of the American College of Obstetricians

        not easy. It will require a major change in attitudes for patients, for 
        obstetricians, for nurses, for hospitals, and for families... We need 
        to close the gap between what we know to be an appropriate cesarean rate 
        and what is actually done in practice. We could get a health bargain for 
        women and a financial bargain for our health care system.&quot;</font>
