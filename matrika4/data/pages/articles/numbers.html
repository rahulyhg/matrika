            Looking At Numbers</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
            dramatic reduction in the number of obstetricians must undoubtedly 
            be balanced by an appropriate increase in the number of midwives. 
            A different proportion of midwives to obstetricians cannot be reached 
            overnight….</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
            transition should be easier and faster in countries where there already 
            a comparatively great number of midwives and a moderate number of 
            obstetricians. It is noticeable that such countries are those with 
            the best possible statistics. For example, in Sweden, there are about 
            6000 midwives for a population of about 9,000,000 (compared with 5,000 
            certified nurse midwives for the whole of the USA!) and a comparatively 
            small number of obstetricians. Sweden has the best birth outcomes 
            in the Western world, with a moderate rate of caesareans that remained 
            pretty stable, around 11 per cent, for almost 20 years. In Holland, 
            80 per cent of the midwives are independent. When a woman is pregnant 
            her reflex is more often than not to visit a midwife. The role of 
            the midwife is to decide, during pregnancy and birth, if she needs 
            the advice or the service of a doctor. Yet she is not answerable to 
            any doctor. During labour the mother and the midwife can decide to 
            stay at home and the rate of home births is around 30 per cent (it 
            is below 2 percent in all other industrialised countries). Less than 
            5 percent of Dutch women presently need an epidural anaesthesia during 
            labour and the rate of caesareans, in the reion of 10 percent is the 
            lowest in Western Europe.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
            Japan, a country with many midwives, they never developed huge maternity 
            hospitals with thousands of births a year, one of the main features 
            of industrialised childbirth. The average number of births a year 
            in a maternity hospital is in the region of 500. Japan has the lowest 
            ‘perinatal mortality rate’ (number of babies who spent more than six 
            months in the womb and died before the age of a week) in the world, 
            with a moderate rate of caesareans and a rate of epidurals still lower 
            than in Holland.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
            comparisons between countries inpire many comments and questions. 
            They clearly indicate that, in general, births are easier in countries 
            where the doctor is usually kept away.</font></p>

          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mothers 
            themselves in the course of difficult labours would have offered prayers 
            to the Virgin and to saints. The patron saint of childbirth was St. 
            Margaret. No matter that she was martyred rather than married, her 
            experience during torture of being swallowed and spat out by a dragon 
            gave her unrivalled powers of empathy with the processes of birth 
            and women in labour listened to readings from her Life. A similar 
            process of association must account for the prayer in the Sarum liturgy 
            to be said for a pregnant woman addressed as it is to God “who delivered 
            Jonah from the whale’s belly.”</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Up 
            and down the country saints, both male and female could be expected 
            to help women in labour: at Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire, pregnant 
            women ‘were very desirous’ to have the staff of St Modwena ‘to lean 
            on’; at Rievaulx Abbey in Yorkshire, monks guarded the girdle of St 
            Ailred, known as it was to be ‘helpful to lying-in-women’. In 1538 
            the Bishop of Salisbury gave instructions that midwives in his diocese 
            were not to use ‘girdles, purses, measures of our Lady or such other 
            superstitious things’.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
            are earlier references to superstitious practices which, from the 
            early Reformation, ecclesiastics were trying to eradicate: in The 
            Sickness of Women mention is made of ‘a girdle of hart’s skin’ and 
            of the beneficial powers of the ‘precious stone called jasper’, though 
            this text as a whole is marked by the absence of such prophylactics. 
            However, this should not be understood as evidence of learned as opposed 
            to popular—or rustic—medicine. The use of birth girdles cut across 
            both time and class…. At Westminster Abbey the monks guarded the Virgin’s 
            own girdle, this had been given to them by Edward the Confessor and 
            it was available on loan for aristocratic and royal births.</font>
