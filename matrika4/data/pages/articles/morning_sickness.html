            Morning Sickness</font></font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Between 
            1 and 2% of pregnant women experience hyperemesis gravidarium, or 
            severe morning sickness. A randomized, placebo-controlled crossover 
            study found that stimulating acupuncture point PC6 helps ease nausea 
            and vomiting. Thirty-three women (average age 28.4 years) were divided 
            into two groups. Group A received deep needle insertion at the PC6 
            point on both forearms three times per day for 30 minutes. Group B 
            received a form of placebo acupuncture, with a needle inserted superficially 
            approximately four inches above the wrist on each arm. On days one 
            and two of the eight-day study, each group received their treatments; 
            after two more days of no treatment, the procedures were switched 
            for each group. Each day, the women rated degree of nausea and recorded 
            instances of vomiting. Those women given active acupuncture experienced 
            a &quot;significantly faster reduction of nausea&quot; compared with 
            those who received a placebo. This reduction was seen in both groups; 
            identical results were seen in each group when the treatment was switched. 
            The incidence of vomiting was also reduced in both groups, with a 
            much greater reduction seen in those receiving active acupuncture. 
            Daily vomiting had been reported by all 22 women at the study onset; 
            by day three less than half of the women in the active group were 
            still vomiting compared with 75% of those in the placebo group.</font></p>
