            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mother-friendly 
            birth centers, hospitals, and home birth services will let a birthing 
            mother decide whom she wants to have with her during the birth. This 
            includes fathers, partners, children, other family members, or friends.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            They will also let a birthing mother have with her a person who has 
            special training in helping women cope with labor and birth. This 
            person is called a doula or labor support person. She never leaves 
            the birthing mother alone. She encourages her, comforts her, and helps 
            her understand what's happening to her.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            They will have midwives as part of their staff so that a birthing 
            mother can have a midwife with her if she wants to.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="hd"><strong>2. 
            Ask, &quot;What happens during a normal labor and birth in your setting?&quot;</strong></span><br />
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If they give mother-friendly 
            care, they will tell you how they handle every part of the birthing 
            process. For example, how often do they give the mother a drug to 
            speed up the birth? Or do they let labor and birth usually happen 
            on its own timing?</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            They will also tell you how often they do certain procedures. For 
            example, they will have a record of the percentage of C-sections (Cesarean 
            births) they do every year. If the number is too high, you'll want 
            to consider having your baby in another place or with another doctor 
            or midwife.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            Here are some numbers we recommend you ask about.</font></font></p>

              not do an episiotomy (ee-pee-zee-AH-tummy) on more than 1 in 5 women 
              (20%). They should be trying to bring that number down. (An episiotomy 
              is a cut in the opening to the vagina to make it larger for birth. 
              It is not necessary most of the time.) </font></li>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They should 
              not do C-sections on more than 1 in 10 women (10%) if it's a community 
              hospital. The rate should be 15% or less in hospitals which care 
              for many high-risk mothers and babies. </font> </li>

          </ul>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            A C-section is a major operation in which a doctor cuts through the 
            mother's stomach into her womb and removes the baby through the opening. 
            Mothers who have had a C-section can often have future babies normally. 
            Look for a birth place in which 6 out of 10 women (60%) or more of 
            the mothers who have had C-sections go on to have their other babies 
            through the birth canal.</font></font></p>
          <p class="hd"> <font class="hd" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>3. 
            Ask, &quot;How do you allow for differences in culture and beliefs?&quot;

          <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Mother-friendly birth centers, hospitals, and home birth services are 
          sensitive to the mother's culture. They know that mothers and families 
          have differing beliefs, values, and customs. </font><font size="2"></font></font> 
          <p> <font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example, 
            you may have a custom that only women may be with you during labor 
            and birth. Or perhaps your beliefs include a religious ritual to be 
            done after birth. There are many other examples that may be very important 
            to you. If the place and the people are mother-friendly, they will 
            support you in doing what you want to do. Before labor starts tell 
            your doctor or midwife special things you want.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="hd"><strong>4. 
            Ask, &quot;Can I walk and move around during labor? What position 
            do you suggest for birth?&quot;</strong></span><br />
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In mother-friendly 
            settings, you can walk around and move about as you choose during 
            labor. You can choose the positions that are most comfortable and 
            work best for you during labor and birth. (There may be a medical 
            reason for you to be in a certain position.) Mother-friendly settings 
            almost never put a woman flat on her back with her legs up in stirrups 
            for the birth.</font></font></p>

            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ask, &quot;Can 
            my doctor or midwife come with me if I have to be moved to another

          <p> <font size="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mother-friendly 
            places and people will have a specific plan for keeping in touch with 
            the other people who are caring for you. They will talk to others 
            who give you birth care. They will help you find people or agencies 
            in your community to help you. For example, they may put you in touch 
            with someone who can help you with breastfeeding.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="hd"><strong>6. 
            Ask, &quot;What things do you normally do to a woman in labor?&quot;</strong></span><br />
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Experts say some 
            methods of care during labor and birth are better and healthier for 
            mothers and babies. Medical research shows us which methods of care 
            are better and healthier. Mother-friendly settings only use methods 
            that have been proven to be best by scientific evidence.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes 
            birth centers, hospitals, and home birth services use methods that 
            are not proven to be best for the mother or the baby. For example, 
            research has shown it's usually not helpful to break the bag of waters.</font></font></p>

            should suggest such things as changing your position, relaxing in
