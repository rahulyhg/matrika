        There are many reasons why further studies about labour induction as a 
        possible risk factor for autism are urgently needed. The first one is 
        that the authors of the oldest studies included in our database came across 
        risks associated with induction, whereas the most recent studies could 
        not take into account this variable. &quot;Labour induction&quot; should 
        be explicitly taken into consideration, because it can be associated either 
        with birth by the vaginal route (with or without intervention such as 
        forceps), or with caesarean birth. Another reason is that the epidemic 
        of autism and the epidemic of induction seem to have developed side by 
        side. Most importantly, a third reason is that the results of recent studies 
        suggest that children with autistic disorder show alterations in their 
        oxytocin system.</font></font></p>
