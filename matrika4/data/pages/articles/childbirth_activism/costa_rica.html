	<h1>Campaign to humanise birth in Costa Rica</h1>
	Launching of the campaign for the humanisation of childbirth in Costa
	Rica Changing childbirth will improve life for all people.<br />
	<br />
	We demand the recognition and implementation of international
	recommendations for improving the quality of care of women and babies at
	the time of birth We denounce the mistreatment, abuse and humiliation of
	women and babies in hospital labour and delivery wards.<br />
	<br />
	Many international studies, publications and agencies point out that
	hospital practices in childbirth are not based on scientific evidence,
	and that modernising health attention during one of the most important
	events in life, birth, should be priority for all governments. Routines
	carried out indiscriminately and daily in the majority of births
	(intravenous infusions with pitocin, vaginal exams, lithotomy position,
	separation of baby and mother, just to name a few) are being questioned
	by a group of concerned citizens who have set out to show that "Changing
	childbirth will improve life for all people". <br />
	<br />
	On May 28th (international women´s health day) Primal Association is
	launching a national campaign to "humanise childbirth", a campaign to
	distribute information and propose changes in the way childbirth is
	"managed" in health care centres; babies should have the right to be
	born in a peaceful environment and not be harmed by routines that are
	painful or distressing, and women should have the right to a safe and
	satisfying birth experience. <br />
	<br />
	<blockquote>The harm caused by modern childbirth practices
	affect all of us. Moreover, women are being denied their need to
	actively participate in their own births, and the physiological and
	natural process of giving birth has been converted into a mechanical and
	artificial procedure by the medical industry. "It´s clear that hospitals
	don´t have the appropriate conditions for the sacred and natural events
	of giving birth and being born, because hospital are built for sickness
	and medical emergencies" points out Gabriela Cob, psychologist and one
	of the organisers of the campaign. "Recent cases of maternal mortality
	in hospital have made it clear to us that "normal birth" requires
	different treatment, for example, homebirth attended by professional
	midwives with accessible transportation to health facilities for medical
	backup (as we see in several countries with excellent results), or in
	centres dedicated exclusively to the care of pregnant women, during
	birth and in the postpartum period" affirmed Marie Tyndall, midwife and
	anthropologist, and one of the organisers of the campaign to humanise
	birth in Costa Rica.</blockquote>
	<br />
	<br />
	One thousand colourful, illustrated and informative brochures (in
	Spanish) are being distributed in Costa Rica to individuals, the press
	and to hospitals. In it a woman gives testimony of her experience of
	giving birth in a hospital in Costa Rica, and it is explained why and
	how childbirth should and could be very different. "Dangerous practices
	experienced daily by women in hospitals" are described, as well as a
	series of proposals which would transform and humanise childbirth. Three
	routines are discussed at length: vaginal exams, episiotomies and the
	lithotomy position. "Vaginal exams threaten the natural protection of
	mother and baby by risking premature rupture of membranes with the
	possibility of infecting the mother and the baby; and of course this
	procedure is at best uncomfortable, but for many women, painful and
	humiliating." The dangers of the lithotomy position, "the most
	uncomfortable and least helpful position to give birth in, and the
	justification for doing episiotomies", as well as the dangers of
	episiotomy, "the cause of the majority of deep and extended tears, and
	in many cases results in painful and debilitating infections" are
	described.<br />
	<br />
	We should overcome our passivity and expect more from our health
	services. First we need to create awareness about supporting women in
	such an important moment. Women and health professionals alike need to
	understand the importance of letting each birth unfold in its unique way
	and that birthing women should decide how, with whom and where to give
	birth, to actively participate and be actively attended to, to create a
	supportive, respectful and caring environment. "These are some of the
	recommendations of international agencies and experts in the field (OMS,
	CLAP, Sheila Kitzinger, Michel Odent, Caldeyro-Barcia, Henci Goer) and
	social movements to humanise childbirth, which are gaining momentum all
	over the world" states the document. <br />
	<br />
	Finally, the brochure sets out a series of steps to humanise birth:<br />
	<ul>
		<li>up-to-date information and respectful treatment for women
		during pregnancy, birth and postpartum</li>
		<li>Obstetric practice based on the most recent scientific
		evidence</li>
		<li>Ending of impunity for the use of dangerous and illicit drugs
		used to induce birth. "Cytotec" is currently being applied as the drug
		of choice, and is believed to be responsible for maternal deaths and
		stillbirths.</li>
		<li>Make known and demand the observance of the "rules" stated in
		government health service documents (Article 76: womens´ childbirth
		rights)</li>
		<li>informed choice for all childbearing women: to decide about
		all medical interventions and have information and access to
		alternatives.</li>
		<li>attention during pregnancy and childbirth based on the
		humanistic model of care.</li>
	</ul>
