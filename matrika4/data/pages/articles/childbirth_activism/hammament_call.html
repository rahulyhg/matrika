	<blockquote>Every minute a woman dies somewhere in the
	world and many more are left disabled due to pregnancy-related
	complications, because they lack access to skilled midwifery care.
	Evidence shows that a midwife or other healthcare provider with
	midwifery skills offers the most cost-effective, low technology but high
	quality solution to achieving safe motherhood, a central component of
	reproductive health. In addition, midwives are crucial to help ensure
	newborn survival, improve maternal and newborn health and therefore
	reduce the estimated 7 million perinatal deaths that currently occur
	each year.</blockquote>
	The 1st International Forum in Hammamet, Tunisia, on â€œMidwifery in the
	Communityâ€�, organized by the International Confederation of Midwives,
	the United Nations Population Fund and the World Health Organization,
	concluded its week-long deliberations with a Call to Action for the
	strengthening and scaling up of midwifery in the community - to
	contribute to the prevention of the avoidable death and disability of
	mothers and their newborns, as well as promoting the health of mothers
	and babies. <br />
	<br />
	The Forum gathered international agencies and organizations, along with
	midwives, nurses, physicians, health policy makers, professional
	associations, regulatory bodies and researchers from 23 countries around
	the world where maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity remain
	unacceptably high. The objective was to consider how to make midwifery
	care more accessible, especially to women living in hard to reach and
	underserved areas. Having reviewed progress and constraints over these
	last twenty years, since the launch of the Safe Motherhood Global
	Initiative, participants concluded that intensified action is needed at
	global, regional and national levels to achieve the additional midwives
	needed to work in contact with communities. Midwives working in close
	proximity to where women live will help prevent 530,000 avoidable
	maternal deaths a year. In addition will also prevent many post delivery
	problems such as obstetric fistula, and help to reduce the alarming rate
	of neonatal morbidity and mortality. In 2005 the World Health
	Organization estimated that 334,000 more midwives and others with
	midwifery skills are needed around the world. If well supported by
	effective health systems, midwives will help governments to achieve
	their fourth and fifth Millennium Development Goals by 2015.<br />
	<br />
	The Call to Action says: <br />
	<br />
	We, the participants of the 1st International Forum on Midwifery in the
	Community, call on governments, regulatory bodies, professional health
	care organizations, educators, and communities worldwide to ensure the
	provision of midwifery services in the community by establishing or
	improving the following key areas: <br />
	<ul>
		<li>Policies to ensure equitable access to midwifery services</li>
		<li>Policies and regulatory systems to improve the number,
		deployment, status and conditions of work of midwives and others with
		midwifery skills</li>
		<li>Competency based education and training in midwifery skills</li>
		<li>Peer and supportive supervision of providers in the field</li>
		<li>An enabling environment to support effective healthcare
		delivery, including infrastructure, communication, emergency
		transportation, adequate funding, equipment and supplies</li>
		<li>Permanent monitoring and periodic evaluation.</li>
	</ul>
	We believe that these actions will strengthen midwifery as an integrated
	part of the healthcare in the community. In addition they will improve
	the continuum of care needed to protect the health of women and babies,
	as well as save their lives by increasing access to emergency obstetric
	and neonatal care (EmONC). <br />
	<br />
	We also believe that it is the collective obligation of all stakeholders
	to guarantee mothers and their newborns their human rights to safe
	pregnancy, childbirth, and a safe postpartum recovery wherever they may
	live. <br />
