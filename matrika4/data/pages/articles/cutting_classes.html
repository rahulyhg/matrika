        Cutting class? (Sara Krulwich/The New York Times)

        <b>Pregnant women are cutting childbirth class.<br />

        Although women are more obsessed than ever with health during their pregnancies,
        they seem to have lost interest in learning about the end of pregnancy, also known
        as childbirth, reports the November issue of Fit Pregnancy magazine.
        <br />
        <br />
        "Fewer women are taking classes,'' said Jeannette Crenshaw, president of Lamaze
        International. Ms. Crenshaw told the magazine that she believes several issues explain
        why women aren't as interested in learning about childbirth. Many women, she says,
        are convinced they can't deliver a baby without epidural pain relief. Television
        shows often depict birth as a dangerous event, even though serious problems are
        exceedingly rare among women delivering in the United States. And because many women
        work until nearly the last day of pregnancy, busy schedules often prevent them from
        scheduling a birthing class.

        <br />
        Marjie Hathaway, co-director of the American Academy of Husband-Coached Childbirth,
        which teaches what's known as the Bradley Method of natural childbirth, also told
        the magazine that interest in childbirth classes has waned. "Today, women are more
        focused on prenatal testing and monitoring the pregnancy than in learning how to
        give birth,'' she said.
        <br />
        <br />
        Research shows that there's no real difference in pain, labor interventions or birth
        outcomes among women who take childbirth classes and those who don't, the magazine
        reports. The classes appear to attract women who are the most vigilant about their
        health during pregnancy. Women who enroll in a childbirth class are more likely
        to have quit smoking, keep prenatal appointments and to breastfeed after birth,
        the magazine notes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Childbirth education started in the 1940s, after a British obstetrician published
        the book "Childbirth Without Fear," advocating relaxation techniques to ease pain
        and fear during labor. French obstetrician Dr. Fernand Lamaze developed focused
        breathing techniques to help with the pain of childbirth.
        <br />
        <br />
        But today hospital-based classes tend to focus more on a tour of hospital facilities
        rather than techniques to cope with labor pain. The magazine argues that women's
        declining interest in childbirth classes is worrisome because it's happening even
        as childbirth has become more "medicalized'' than ever. During childbirth, a number
        of variables can arise and women have to make informed decisions about procedures
        like epidurals, episiotomies, induction and C-sections. "That's where you reap the
        dividends of having had a teacher who explained each possible intervention and showed
        you how to be your advocate,'' the magazine reports.

        The Fit Pregnancy Web site offers several descriptions of the different types of
        childbirth classes as well as contact info to find a class.
