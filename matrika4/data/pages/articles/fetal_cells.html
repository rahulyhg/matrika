            In their search for a treatment for stroke or diseases such as Alzheimer's, 
            researchers at the National University of Singapore and Singapore 
            General Hospital confirmed that fetal cells, known to remain in the 
            mother's body for long periods of time and sometimes the mother's 
            lifetime, may migrate to the mother's brain and develop into new nervous 
            system cells. The maternal brains of laboratory mice were found to 
            have one to ten fetal cells per 1000 maternal cells capable of transforming 
            into neurons; astrocytes, which feed neurons; oligodendrocytes, which 
            insulate neurons; and macrophages, which ingest germs and damaged 
            cells. Following chemically induced injury to the maternal brains, 
            nearly six times as many fetal cells were found in the damaged areas 
            than elsewhere, seemingly responding to molecular distress signals 
            released by the brain. <br />

            The researchers speculate that the fetal cells travel through the 
            capillaries separating the brain from the blood system by means of 
            interaction between biomolecules such as proteins or sugars on the 
            fetal cell and the blood-brain barrier. </font></font> </p>
