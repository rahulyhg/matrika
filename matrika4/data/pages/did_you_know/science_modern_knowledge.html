    <ul>
        <li>Science and modern knowledge systems were developed in 17th Century Europe among
            a group of elite men, outside of the Universities, that were controlled by the Church.
            They explicitly and implicitly excluded women for 300 years. (And also lower class
            men and men of color.) </li>
        <li>In England the Royal Society was founded in 1660 and the first woman was admitted
            in 1945. </li>
        <li>In the United States Smith College was founded in 1875 as the first educational
            institution following the same curriculum as men’s elite Ivy League colleges to
            which women had no access. At the time of its founding, the dean of the Harvard
            medical school published a book in which he argued that a rigorous intellectual
            curriculum would shrivel a woman’s uterus since all her blood would have to go to
            her brain. </li>
        <li>One characteristic of this system was that it depended on a new worldview—one in
            which the non-human world was machine-like, had no consciousness or agency. God
            was understood to be the creator of the world, likened to a master clockmaker of
            an inert and unconscious universe. God wound up the clock and gave it its working
            rules, the “laws of nature”. </li>
        <li>Human beings (male) endowed with a God-like mind could figure out the rules—they
            are called the ‘laws of nature’. </li>
        <li>Spirit or soul was removed from nature—nature was inert and nature and culture were
            totally separate, becoming categories that are mutually exclusive in the sense that
            culture is what nature is not and nature is what culture is not. </li>
        <li>According to Boyd, the father of the scientific experimental method, God could create
            and annihilate but Nature could do neither. Thus experimental science was fully
            legitimated to act upon nature. Women could not participate in these experiments
            since women were equated with nature. </li>
        <li>These changes in worldview overlapped with the ‘Enclosure movement’—land being enclosed
            and privately owned. Before many people had rights to land. The European ‘commons’
            was the material foundation of peasant social life. Land became a ‘resource’ and
            peasants were removed by the ‘owners’. Livelihoods, social life, sacredness of land
            were all eroded. </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>“The Age of Reason was built on the Ashes of European Shamanesses”</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>The emergence of this knowledge system corresponded with the witchhunts (most of
            whom were women) and the persecution of other ‘heretics’. In Europe these were bloody
            centuries, full of religious and class wars. There was a prominence of women in
            the peasant rebellions. </li>
        <li>The wise women (in French Sage Fem, in Hindi Samajwali—she who knows) lived in local
            communities mostly practicing subsistence agriculture. They articulated the agency
            of the non-human world through expressions of gratitude, reciprocity, language of
            the spirit, as well as gift exchange. </li>
        <li>Nature’s powers of Regeneration were not separate from human regeneration. Psychotropic
            substances, communication with the dead, rituals all facilitated regeneration. </li>
        <li>In the earlier worldview there was a world soul, Anima Mundi, and all of matter
            was full of life. The world was full of God. The five elements (the panchmahabhuta)
            linked the human and non-human world. </li>
        <li>The shaman—plant—ritual—forest or jungle all co-created each other in this cosmovision.
        </li>
