            Socio-Economic Situation of Jehangirpuri <i>basti </i>
            <br />
        </font>
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Matrika, in collaboration with Action India (NGO), held a few workshops with <i>dais</i>
        of Jehangirpuri. Action India has been doing development projects in this area for
        a long time. In its various health programmes it realised that <i>dais</i> were
        handling majority of the births in this area. Matrika&#8217;s workshop helped in
        bringing the <i>dais</i> together as a group. They now have regular monthly meetings
        to discuss their problems and future plans to get organised.</p>
    <p class="lrgtxt">
        Location of Jehangirpuri <i>basti </i>
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        It is a resettlement colony located in the north-eastern part of Delhi. It is close
        to Azadpur, a wholesale vegetable market, which supplies vegetables to a very large
        population of Delhi. On one side is the Karnal industrial area and on the other
        side is Adarsh Nagar residential colony where some upper middle class and middle
        class sections of Delhi resides.
    </p>
    <p class="lrgtxt">
        Background</p>
    <p class="default">
        Jehangirpuri resettlement colony came up during the National Emergency in 1975.
        25 sq. ft. of land was given to the poor under &#8216;Garibi Hatao&#8217; (removal
        of poverty) and demolition of Jhuggi-Jhonpri (slums) schemes.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Families had come from various regions of the country. Many came from the drought
        hit Rajasthan in 1966-&#8217;67. They were families of labourers who were earning
        a living by breaking stones or as construction labourers. Many also came from the
        districts of Banda, Itawa, Jhansi, Meerut and Bulandshahar of eastern U. P. Some
        came from Punjab and Haryana. All these people used to live before in the slums
        of central Delhi and old Delhi and in 1975 they shifted to Jehangirpuri.</p>
    <p class="lrgtxt">
        Realities of <i>basti </i>
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Jehangirpuri has been divided into alphabetical blocks. In each block, people of
        a particular region live together. Like, in &#8216;I&#8217; block Rajasthanis live,
        in &#8216;G&#8217; block its mainly the ones from U. P. In spite of long years of
        stay in Delhi, the Rajasthani women still wear their traditional dress, lehanga
        and <em>chunari</em>. Many have no contact with their village folks but they still
        follow their customs.</p>
    <p class="default">
        95% of the houses are<em> pukka </em>and are made of bricks and look very modern,
        with marble floors, tiles, glass doors and windows. Many houses have two or three
        storeys and are worth four to four and a half lakhs. Many sold their houses/plots
        to merchants and small industrialists and shifted to some slum area. These merchants
        and small industrialists bought houses/plots for business work. Many lower middle
        class families have also shifted to live here. Because of this buying and selling
        of plots/houses, one can see hoardings of property dealers in the area.</p>
    <p class="lrgtxt2">
        Houses</p>
    <p class="default">
        In these small spaces almost eight to ten members of the family live together. There
        is no toilet in these houses and there is no separate space for the kitchen. A small
        space of the drawing room is converted into kitchen. The kitchen water flows out
        into the open drain, which is flowing outside the houses. Two-third of the population
        has gas stove for cooking and some still use kerosene stoves for cooking. In many
        houses there are two separate spaces for kitchen. One each, for the mother-in-law
        and the daughter-in-law. There is just one window in the front room. There is no
        ventilation for air circulation. There are no overhead tanks for storage of water.
        In the peak of summer, due to shortage of water, water is supplied by water tankers
        of the municipal corporation of Delhi.</p>
    <p class="lrgtxt2">
        <i>basti </i>Planning</p>
    <p class="default">
        The <i>basti </i>is spread in five -six kms. radius. The outer blocks of the <i>basti
        </i>(&#8216;A&#8217; &amp; &#8216;L&#8217;), have shops and look like a market area.
        The whole area is very congested. On one side is Jehangirpuri main bus stand. There
        are many manual rickshaws, one of the only means to move around in the narrow lanes
        of the <i>basti </i>s. As one enters the <i>basti </i>, more shops can be seen of
        stationery, cosmetics and medicines. Many people earn a living by selling vegetables.
        They buy the left over stale vegetables sold at a reduced price from the Azadpur
        wholesale market. These are then bought by <i>basti </i>dwellers. Besides, people
        move around on bicycles or on foot, selling readymade garments and steel/hindalium
        utensils. There are also electric and gold/silver jewellery shops.</p>
    <p class="default">
        On one side of the <i>basti </i>, there is a huge market of recycled plastic wastes.
        There are mounds of plastic bags, old clothes and other junk. This area is particularly
        very dirty. Many men and women work and earn a living by sorting out the junk material.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Unhygienic living conditions due to pathetic drainage system, dumping of plastic
        and no proper toilet facilities has led to outbreaks of epidemics. It is a breeding
        ground for mosquitoes and flies.</p>
    <p class="lrgtxt2">
        Medical Facilities</p>
    <p class="default">
        Almost in every street one finds a shop of an RMP, an Ayurvedic practitioner or
        a homeopath doctor. There are also government dispensaries, which have a doctor
        and a nurse, Very few go to these dispensaries. Most rely on these private health
        practitioners for all kinds of ailments, cough, cold, fever or injury. Many of these
        practitioners have a small space for conducting deliveries and abortions.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Sabla Sangh of Action India also has a health centre. Many women come here for a
        check-up. Most of the treatment is done through herbs and spices.</p>
    <p class="default">
        In case of an emergency, the <i>basti </i>people go to private nursing homes, many
        borrow money for it. Pant and Hindu Rao are the two closest government hospitals.
        In very difficult cases, they go there.</p>
    <p class="default">
        There are also vaids, bonesetters and other healers. People have a lot of faith
        in them. Many of them come from quite a distance to get treated.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        There are also small parks within the <i>basti </i>. But this is just an empty space.
        Many use it to dump waste. Children play cricket here. During marriages or <em>Puja</em>,
        this space gets used.</p>
    <p class="default">
        <span class="lrgtxt2">Other realities</span></p>
    <p class="default">
        There are government schools. Dropout at middle school is very high. Very few manage
        to study till high school level. School going children also engage in small jobs
        for earning extra for the families. Young boys work in factories and girls shell
        green gram. In fact, the women after finishing their household chores, are engaged
        in various activities like shelling green gram, making paper packets, sticking labels
        on boxes, making <i>bindi</i> packets etc. They earn 10-12 rupees per day. Factory
        people come and hand over this work to <i>basti </i>folks. Surely labour is cheaper
        than machines. Some women also work as domestic help.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Men work in factories, drive auto-rickshaws or repair gas stoves/pressure cookers.
        They go to upper-middle colonies on their bicycles with their repair kits. There
        are very few who have permanent jobs.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Political party agents play a very important role in this <i>basti </i>. Both Congress
        and Bhartiya Janta Party are present. <i>basti </i>s are a major vote bank for these
        political functionaries. The <i>basti </i>people make use of these party politicians
        for getting their Ration Cards, Old Age Pensions and Widow pensions. In police cases
        also, the <i>basti </i>people approach the local party political leader for help.</p>
    <p class="lrgtxt">
        Action India</p>
    <p class="default">
        It started in 1970 and in 1984 it started working in four resettlement colonies
        &#8211; Nandnagri, New Seemapuri, Jehangirpuri and Dakshinpuri. They started with
        Health Programmes. They trained some women from the <i>basti </i>as Health Workers.
        These health workers participated in a health programme for <i>basti </i>s. They
        also took up other issues of the <i>basti </i>s, like water, electricity problems,
        primary health care and violence against women.</p>
    <p class="default">
        They had small groups working on Fertility Awareness. It was divided into various
        age groups, a separate group was made for adolescent girls. The women discussed
        their body and health problems. They had self-help groups where information was
        imparted on use of <em>jari-booti</em> (herbs). A programme called <em>Apni Rasoi</em>
        (my kitchen), started on food and drinks and easily available kitchen spices that
        could be used for treatment/remedies. Separate meetings of each programme with each
        age group, was held by the health workers.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The health workers learnt about<em> jari-booti </em>and indigenous healing practices
        by getting special training from <em>vaidyas</em> and healers. In their centres,
        these herbal medicines are prepared and kept. They prescribe these medicines and
        charge a very nominal fee.</p>
    <p class="lrgtxt">
        <i>dai </i>Programme</p>
    <p class="default">
        Action India had their first direct interaction with <i>dais</i> after Matrika&#8217;s
        first workshop. For the <i>dai </i>project, Jehangirpuri <i>basti </i>was chosen
        as the focus area since birth was handled mainly by the <i>dais</i> themselves.
        They started with monthly meetings and recently, they also introduced saving schemes
        amongst the <i>dais</i>.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The <i>dais</i> are from U.P., Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. Rajasthani <i>dais</i>
        are traditional practitioners and handle birth according to their traditional knowledge.
        They have not been exposed to modern systems. But they are very confident about
        their traditional knowledge and skills.</p>
    <p class="default">
        <i>dai </i>work is an additional work for the Rajasthani practitioners. They consider
        it to be <i>sewa ka kaam </i>(social service). They earn their living by breaking
        stones.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        The <i>dais</i> from other regions also have traditional knowledge and handle birth
        accordingly. However, many have links with the local R. M. P.s&#8217; nursing homes
        and have also received short-term training from hospitals. Many took up <i>dai </i>
        work because of economic reasons, they being the sole bread earners of the family.
        Some had worked with doctors, and then independently started working as <i>dais</i>.
        Many <i>dais</i>, in these urban set-up, have replaced the traditional ritual practices
        with the newly acquired modern symbols of hygiene &#8211; gloves, <i>sui-goli</i>,
        and the birth kit. These have become symbols of power &#8211; they attract people,
        as traditional ritual practices are now considered superstitious.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Almost 90% of the deliveries are handled by the <i>dais</i>. In case of complications
        they take the women to the nearest government hospitals or nursing homes.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Action India is trying to fill this gap that exists between the ethno-medical and
        bio-medical systems. It also feels that the <i>dais</i> have to be organised if
        they have to get proper remuneration and status in society. The <i>dais</i> also
        agree with this and want to get organised as an assertive labour force.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="lrgtxt">Income Generation</span></p>
    <p class="default">
        Initiated in early 1995, the income generation programme gives interest free loans
        ranging from Rs.1,000 to Rs. 10,000 to help women improve micro-enterprises and
        become self determining. The women, most of whom are daily wage earners, feel this
        has solved the problem of high interest rates; earlier Rs.100 borrowed from a money
        lender in the morning, had to be returned as Rs.105 that very night.</p>
    <p class="lrgtxt">
        Saving Groups</p>
    <p class="default">
        There are 20 women in each saving group. Action India provides the initial direction
        and facilitates the process of group formation. Women themselves take responsibility
        and frame the rules for the group functioning.</p>
    <p class="lrgtxt">
        Sabla Sanghs</p>
    <p>
        <span class="default">Earlier, action India worked only with women, among whom it formed
            Sabla Sanghs. It has now extended its work to girls, on the assumption that change
            takes time. Also, girls have more potential for change. The following groups have
            been formed-- Sabla Sangh (women between 22 and 60 years), Chhoti Sabla Sangh (adolescent
            girls between 13 and 22 years) and Nanhi Sabla Sangh (pre-adolescent girls between
            9 and 13 years).</span><br />
