        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">This workshop in Fatehgarh District, Punjab posed special problems
                for the Matrika team, as none of us were fluent in Punjabi (unlike all the other
                areas where we held workshops where at least one team member spoke the local language.)
                The whole workshop was conducted in village Punjabi therefore the team needed assistance
                from VHAP for documentation and facilitation. Also our collaborating NGO, the Voluntary
                Health Association of Punjab, does not function like the other NGOs that we had
                worked with. The others had health workers working at the grassroots field level
                and who know the <i>dais</i> and the language. Therefore we had to rely on professional
                women, removed from the field level, Dr. Tulika, a gynaecologist and Veena, a lawyer,
                who spoke Punjabi and helped us in workshop facilitation.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">During the pre-workshop orientation Matrika's documentation procedure
                was explained to Manisha and Reena of VHAP. However after the workshop we realised
                that the written documents were incomplete. This was because our workshop process
                was very new for them and so was the documentation procedure. Thus we had to rely
                mainly on the audio- tapes recorded during workshop to supplement written notes.
                For this we received help from Manjeet who knows Punjabi and works in Jagori a Delhi
                NGO. We learnt from Manjeet that the facilitators at times were unable to translate
                correctly what Matrika members were asking. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">For some songs Renuka also took help from her Punjabi neighbours,
                elderly women from Amritsar. They also knew some of the songs, which they used to
                sing during marriages. Interestingly they did not want to discuss these songs in
                the house as they were shy to talk about these subjects in their husband&#8217;s
                or son's presence. These songs were speaking of women&#8217;s perspectives on lovemaking
                and childbirth. Even during marriages men are not during ladies <i>sangeet</i> (songs).
                So they came outside of the house and very happily shared with Renuka on these topics,
                helping her with translation.
                <br />
                Since the documentation was primarily transcribed from audio tapes some of the names
                of the <i>dais</i> are not noted in this transcript.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">This workshop was held in the Fategarh Sahib <i>Gurdwara </i>and
                the Matrika team stayed here during the nights whereas the VHAP team went back to
                Chandigarh. Everyone (<i>dais</i>, VHAP members and Matrika members) took meals
                at the <i>langar</i> (communal eating place of the <i>Gurdwara </i>). All of us
                went during break times to pay obeisance at the <i>Gurdwara </i>. Some <i>dais</i>
                used to come early in the morning and have holy bath at the <i>sarovar</i> (pond
                in the <i>Gurdwara </i>) </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Our stay in the <i>Gurdwara </i>was possible because of the friendly
                relations between VHAP head, Manmohan Sharma and members of the Gurudwara management
                committee--Lal Mistri a local politician of the <i>Mazhabi </i>Sikh, Jaswant Singh
                Taan and Karnail Singh who were members of <i>Gurdwara </i>management committee.
                These gentlemen inaugurated the workshop and talked about the importance of <i>dais</i>
                work. This was a good opportunity for them as they could indirectly campaign for
                the coming elections, which were upcoming. </span>

            <span class="lrgtxt2">Introduction</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: Matrika's methodology is to focus on <i>dais</i>' strengths.
                What do they know and what are the traditions of learning through which the <i>Dai </i>
                knows her work? The aim is to value her work. We want to look at her strength, skills
                and how she handles birth and understands female body processes.<br />
                Tulika: I am a gynaecologist. When we went to the village to meet <i>dais</i> and
                talked to them they thought that we were from the government, so they talked about
                their training. They were afraid to talk about their traditional knowledge. The
                focus of this Matrika project is on their traditional skills and their experience.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">In our last meeting at Khera, organised by VHAP, I noticed that
                <i>dais</i> have to use their hands and mind to deal with complicated cases, as
                they do not have referral time. There is no regular antenatal check-up so one cannot
                say that there would be a cephallo pelvic disproportion or there will be a case
                of obstructed labour. There was a <i>Dai </i>who had 40 years experience and she
                talked about such cases. However, <i>dais</i> can handle <i>breech </i>and twin
                deliveries.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: Tulika uses medical terms likewise <i>dais</i> will be
                using different words and different language and idioms. We are trying to go between
                these different words and roles.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kishwar: I am working for Matrika for the first time. I am interested
                in<em> reeti rewaz</em> and the psyche of a woman during birth. Some women have
                post partum depression, and some feel good. I want to know what cause these differing
                reactions.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Veena: I am in the legal profession but, besides going to the
                courts, I also work with women and hold workshops and literacy camps on the rights
                of women and reservations for women in <i>Panchayat</i>s. I can share with these
                women the things that I will be learning from this workshop.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Priya: I have come from the USA. I came to India in September
                and studied Public Health in Pune for 3 months. There I was exposed to various ongoing
                projects focusing on women&#8217;s health, family planning and antenatal programs.
                I have just joined Matrika. This project is a much more sensitive project. I was
                frustrated in Pune because most of the work that I was exposed to was very invasive.
                Primary focus was on throwing out tradition and bringing in new and modern methods.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Renuka: I attended Matrika's workshop in Gomia and Delhi and learnt
                many things from the <i>dais</i>. Now I am here in Punjab to learn from <i>dais</i>
                of Punjab. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Reena: I work for VHAP and I am interested to know about <i>dais</i>'
                way of working.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Manisha: I work for VHAP. I like working for women and I write
                stories, which focus on women&#8217;s problems.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: I am in India for the past 20 years. I got frustrated with
                teaching natural childbirth classes, when women couldn&#8217;t have the births they
                wanted and got involved in this topic. I used to help couples and women have babies
                without medication and surgery. But doctors would not help them or allow them to
                do what I suggested so I felt it is wrong to keep up that work. I started doing
                research ten years ago to see how natural childbirth works according to local traditions.
                Then I learnt about <i>dais</i>&#8217; handling of birth. I thought about this project
                and got the funds to carry out this work. My perception is that knowledge of woman's
                body does not exist only in sophisticated knowledge of bio-medical doctors. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>dais</i>&#8217; knowledge is with the woman and it is not a
                textual tradition and it is with low caste, outcaste women. This project aims to
                show that this kind of holistic knowledge is relevant to today and is passed from
                <i>Saas</i> to <i>Bahu</i> and mother to daughter.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Manmohan (the head of VHAP) shared some his observations about
                <i>dais</i> in Punjab with the group.<br />
                <i>dais</i> are from the <i>Chamar jat i</i> (Ravidas) which occupies lowest position
                among the lower caste groups. These days even women from upper caste are doing <i>Dai
                </i>work and are becoming affluent but <i>dais</i> of lower caste are losing their
                traditional work, which is also their means of livelihood and are becoming poorer.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">These days traditional <i>dais</i> are misusing their knowledge
                and skills for sex determination and abortion. Also Ayurveda has come out with something
                that is given in the early weeks of pregnancy for having male child. Also it is
                a problem that <i>dais</i> live in fear that their work may be banned by law as
                medical professionals think that they are quacks.</span></p>

            <span class="default"></span><span class="lrgtxt2">Games/Activities </span><span
                class="default">Through various activities Matrika&#8217;s workshop methods were
                expressed. These were to be tried out in the workshop, they are also ice-breakers.
                We tried out these games with the group. </span>

        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">We decided to begin with the name game and then introduce Matrika
                verbally. We could then do a role play using a narrator to explain the scenes in
                Punjabi. The following role play was decided upon and practiced. </span>

        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Birth Scene: woman in labour pain. Her mother tries to console
                her and then calls a <i>Dai </i>who handles the birth </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Workshop Scene: This <i>Dai </i>and others like her are called
                by Matrika to attend their workshop. In the workshop <i>dais</i> talk about their
                work. Matrika documents and reanalyses their work.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Dissemination Scene: Matrika shares this knowledge with <i>dais</i>

        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: The <i>Gurdwara </i>is considered a sacred place but women
                are considered dirty and polluted when they menstruate or after childbirth. <i>Mazhabi
                </i>Sikh women belong to the polluted caste. They do <i>Dai </i>work which is considered
                dirty (as they work with their hands and touch body fluid, blood and excreta) thus
                they are in a state of permanent pollution. The knowledge of body is with women
                from lower caste. But they are separated and their work is not appreciated in part
                because they are considered polluted. This may influence their ability to speak
                in the <i>Gurdwara </i>. [A fear, which proved unfounded]<br />

        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">We discussed the various themes that we would focus on during
                the Workshop: Birth Atlas; Rituals; Body Mapping; <i>maalish</i>; Songs</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Birth Atlas will be translated in Punjabi. Generating words in
                Punjabi that are used by <i>dais</i> for women&#8217;s body parts. These words are
                often used as <em>gaalis</em> (abuses). Try and understand their ways of explaining
                the body process physiologically. For example they use<em> ruka hua khoon</em> for
                the blood, which comes out after delivery. Matrika is interested to know how they
                determine how open is the cervix. A good doctor or a <i>Dai </i>through external
                signs can say how far that woman is into labour. But doctors and some midwives at
                times do too much of internal examination. At times even families can put a pressure
                on midwife to get the baby out fast. Overuse of hand can lead to swelling and infection.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Doctors thought that placenta was a barrier to many things and
                drugs and <i>dais</i> have sensitivity to the permeability of body and placenta.
                In this regard <i>dais</i> may come up with stories or narratives like the Abhimanyu
                story [In<em> Mahabharata</em>, Arjuna explains to his pregnant wife about <i>Chakravyuha</i>
                (a type of military manoeuvre). As he was finishing the story his wife fell asleep
                and missed the last bit where Arjun was explaining how one could get out <i>Chakravyuha</i>.
                Later Abhimanyu the warrior (their son&#8212;who was in the womb listening to the
                story, learning the manoeuvre, but not the ending because his mother had fallen
                asleep) has to go and fight with the enemies. However, Abhimanyu gets trapped in
                the <i>Chakravyuha</i> since he only knew to enter and fight but did not know how
                to come out]. This story shows how the foetus was considered sensate and learning,
                even in the mother&#8217;s body&#8212;a fact, which is only now being acknowledged
                by the latest scientific research. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Rituals help in taking away the fear. The mother needs support
                and <i>Dai </i>guides her through this transitional phase. Matrika is interested
                in these rituals.</span></p>

                Manmohan: This meeting has been called to develop a relationship with <i>dais</i>
                and to also make way for <i>dais</i>. There is a demand by the medical professionals
                of Punjab that <i>Dai </i>work should be banned therefore we have organised this
                workshop to know about your work and skill and tell others about it. We will start
                this meeting with introduction. For the past 3-4 years I have been working in Punjab
                on health related matters.</span></p>

                and was told that she would have twins. I was called for delivery. I was told that
                she has twins, I took out the first two babies but I saw that her stomach still
                looked very big as if something was standing inside, there was a third baby. It
                came out in a bag, so I broke the bag but unfortunately the baby was dead. I had
                lot of problems but people of my village praised my work as I could at least save
                the two babies who were boys and the mother. But when I told the nurses in the hospital

                no contractions, the <i>bacche dani </i>(uterus) had come so low that its mouth
                could not open. Then my <i>Saas</i> called for her <i>Nanad</i> from the other village.

                buttocks comes out first followed by legs and that I should hold the baby's legs
                and press them towards the mother's stomach very gently because the baby's head
                may get stuck. I did this and the head came out immediately.</span></p>

                the head comes out. Some <i>dais</i> just put their thumb. You can clean your hands

                very strong than we make her squat on the bricks. This position helps put pressure

                needs help then they have to help her. Besides if they register us as members of
                <i>Stri Sehat Sabha </i>(Women&#8217;s Health Committee), then we have the right

            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: When the pain is mild it is difficult to say how

            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: In 8th month, at times one gets <i>kachhe dard </i>
                (false pain). This may happen if the couple has an intercourse. This should be avoided
                as in this month the baby is changing its position. Therefore there was this tradition
                when woman used to go and stay with her mother after 5th month. This was a way of
                avoiding physical relationship.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We also have to be sure that the pains are not <i>

            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We ask her to open the <i>tala</i>(locks), we open

                She needs lot of support and sometimes we <i>dais</i> go on working without even
                drinking water, as we do not have time for it. We are constantly at the side of

                do not leave the new mother alone for the next 5 days. She is given regular massage
                and special massage is done on the stomach. Kajal (kohl) is put in the baby's eyes

            <span class="default">After delivery we watch the colour of the blood that comes out
                if it is dark red then we know all is well. Once the woman starts feeding the baby
                the uterus shrinks to its normal size on its own. Sometimes we have to give special
                massage, we have to apply pressure on the stomach to place the uterus back in position.</span></p>

                me. The birth of a child is also <i>Dai </i>&#8217;s means of getting to know the

            <span class="default">Kako: It is not necessary to do this. If the baby is doing fine
                than we clean the baby's mouth with cotton or cloth and put him next to the mother.
                By this mother and child feel secure and warm. Au (placenta) has life so if the
                baby is weak than we milk the <i>naal </i>towards the baby and then cut it. This
                gives strength and life to the baby as the blood flows into the baby. After this

                After the baby is born we observe <i>tehrawa </i>(13th day) the day when the mother
                and the child are introduced to the people. We also call this <i>Chauke </i>(kitchen)
                Charhna (enter), the woman dresses up like a bride and comes out with her baby and
                <i>matha tekti hai </i>(bows her head and offers prayers). Various kinds of food
                and sweet rice are served for the guests. This is done on the 11th or 13th day and
                in some places on the 21st day. After birth, she is confined to her room till Chauka
                (she can enter the kitchen after this) is celebrated. During these days she is never
                left alone. A <i>rakhi</i> (guard) always accompanies her. This is to protect her
                from evil spirits. In the absence of a grown up boy to guard her, a small boy of
                2-3 years is asked to stay with her. On Chauka day she bathes and steps out of the
                room, taking the support of her husband or her son's or nephew's shoulder. This
                day she wears the shoes of a male member of the family. The mother and baby come
                out to receive every ones&#8217; blessings. It is essential to serve sweet rice.
                Guests bring grain, flour, lentils, rice and clothes. The <i>Dai </i>is given clothes,
                food and grain. After this the <i>Dai </i>only comes if she is called.</span></p>

            <span class="default">In Sikh families they do <i>Paanch vani da paath </i>(five prayers
                recitation) put <i>patisa</i> (sweets) and stir <em>Amrit</em> (holy water) in <em>lohe
                    ka bata</em> (bowl made of iron) with the <i>Khanda</i> (a sacred symbol of
                Sikhs, a double edged sword).This Amrit is first given to mother and baby and then

            <span class="default">Hindu families fetch <em>Ganga Jal</em> (holy water of river Ganga)
                from the <em>panditji </em>and this is sprinkled all over the house to ward off
                evil spirits. Both Hindus and Sikhs believe a lot in cleansing with water, it keeps
                evil spirits away.</span></p>

            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: After 40 days the mother is allowed to go near the
                tap or well or any water source. She dresses up like a bride, wears new clothes,
                and new bangles. She goes and <em>matha teko </em>(bows her head) to the well then
                she goes to Khwaja <i>pir</i>. After this she can use the well.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Renuka : Here we see that water is considered as important as
                the <i>pir</i>. Why do you think this it is so?</span></p>

            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We all believe that water has shakti (power) and
                it is life giving.</span></p>

            <span class="default">Kishwar: So water plays an important role, the baby is in the
                water bag, there is cleansing with water and also avoidance of the well for 40 days--water
                is life giving.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Yes, even in our Vani (scriptures) Guru Nanak says
                &quot;<em>Pehla pani jiyo hai, jith harya sab koy</em>&quot; (water is the first
                living substance which makes things green and alive)</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kishwar: You notice that the well is like a uterus and the bowl
                in which you make Amrit is also like a uterus and the <em>Amrit </em>or <em>Ganga jal</em>
                is water, so water plays an important role in this life giving process. </span>

                shape and brings it forth into this world. Similarly woman also gives babies. However,

                    Dhartimaa tu saada e sab gand sambhal lay </em>(Mother Earth, you take care
                of this dirty stuff). On the 13th day the mother is allowed to use the kitchen.
                This is called Chauka Charhana. Everybody sings and rejoices. There is a celebration.
                Some celebrate this on the seventh or the eleventh day. On this day the mother bathes
                and dresses,<em> halwa </em>(sweet) and different types of food is prepared, friends
                and relatives are invited.<br />
                After 40 days the mother and baby go to the well. They take sweetened rice and cow
                dung cakes and light an oil lamp. Then they go to pay respect (<em>maatha-tekna</em>)
                to the Khwaja <i>pir</i>. <i>Dai </i>also goes with them. But she accompanies the
                family only if a son is born. The whole family sings while going to the Khwaja <i>pir</i>.
                They carry an earthen lamp, cow-dung cakes and rice. Sometimes we make this cow-dung
                cake in the shape of a baby and tie a piece of cloth around it. They give some money,
                Rs.11 or Rs.21 to the <i>Dai </i>.</span></p>

                day when the child will be born. Sometimes she can foretell whether it will be a
                boy or a girl. She is supreme. </span>

                good and bad deeds. She gives form to the baby, makes its hands and feet and organs.

            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Even if the man does not take part in the birth process,

                loha </i>(iron) but she felt that this man can neither die nor can it take birth
                and therefore could not enter the life-cycle. Then she made a form out of raakh
                (ashes) and this is how the cycle of birth and death takes place.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Earlier the earth was inhabited by <i>rakshasas </i>

                They tried to finish the demons, but were not successful. Then came the <i>Devis</i>-

                We suggest healthy nutritious food during pregnancy. Only at the time of delivery
                we give heat producing food. In the early months she usually has nausea then we
                suggest oranges and juices.</span></p>

        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: No, she eats as much as she can digest easily. We

        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Then we take her to the hospital. There they give
                her some medicine or injections. Actually this sickness is usually for the first
                few months. By the fifth month, no such feeling is there then the baby also starts
                drawing on the food so the mother&#8217;s intake also becomes better.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Priya: Do you also suggest some special household work that can

        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Yes, we tell them to do all the usual household work,
                the more active she is the better is her delivery. We ask her to squat and do her
                work, this posture is especially very helpful. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Sometimes women are weak and complain of pain then
                we do tell them to rest but by the seventh month we suggest that they should start
                working so that their bodies are active and agile. We also tell them to improve
                their diet, eat <i>Ghee</i> and start sweeping the floor or mopping on squatting
                position. Then by the ninth month we suggest that she should take hot food like
                hot milk with <i>Ghee</i>.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: If she does not work then we say <i>vele baithe nu
                jayada bimari </i>(one will get ill if one sits idle). Besides if she rests then
                the baby will become heavier. Then the birth becomes more difficult and painful.
                Her body stays active if she keeps busy in her routine work.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Veena: Till seventh month you give her cool food but in the ninth
                month you ask her to have heat producing food. What is the reason? </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Hot foods helps in the opening of the <i>bacha dani</i>
                and thus makes the delivery easier.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Cold food helps in keeping the <i>bacha dani</i>
                firm and helps to hold the baby. Sometimes hot food can soften the uterus and this
                may lead to miscarriage in the third or fourth month. So to keep her pregnancy smooth
                she should take vegetables, juices, lentils and in the last month she should have
                hot food.</span></p>

                Ghee</i>, milk with tea leaves in it, murraba (fruits and vegetables preserved in
                syrup). She should not take too much <i>Ghee</i> but as much as her system allows
                as it may lead to nausea, indigestion or make her feel sick.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Priya: Do these food help in increasing the blood count?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Yes, if she eats well then there is more blood formation.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Sometimes women are very poor and cannot afford to
                improve their diet so there is less nutrition and this affects the water bag, which
                in turn affects the baby. This makes the delivery very difficult and painful. Sometimes
                we ask her to get injections to improve her health.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Priya: Do you massage before delivery?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Yes, we do gentle massage. Sometimes through massage
                we can tell if the water bag is large enough or if it has enough fluid in it. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: If they eat meat and eggs then it is good. We ask
                her to take <i>Sevian </i>(vermicelli sweet with or without milk, and with dry fruits)
                this makes delivery easy. We depend a lot on these natural foods and not on injections.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Veena: If a woman looks pale and weak what special food you suggest?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We give munnaka, dakha, kishmish (dry fruits). This
                helps in increasing the blood count. These can be boiled in milk and given.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Veena: Now that she is in labour then do you give any special
                food?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: It is the same milk with dry fruits, we prepare it
                and keep. We also boil dates and jaggery and keep it and keep putting this in her
                mouth. This hastens the process as it intensifies the pains and also helps to open
                the mouth of the uterus.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: After cleaning the mother and the baby we gently
                press the mother's body (ghutana) give her a glass of hot milk, <i>chawani</i> (a
                mixture of gur and <i>ajwain</i>) this is very soothing for the body which has gone
                through the whole process of birth. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: First two days only <i>chawani</i> is given, twice
                a day with milk and dry fruits. On the third day we give some halwa (a paste made
                out of flour, sugar and <i>Ghee</i>). Some give <em>khichri</em> (a thin mixture
                of rice and lentils and little <i>Ghee</i>). Mostly by fifth or sixth day she can
                have normal food. She can have black gram&#8217;s <em>tari </em>(soup) with her
                <em>roti</em>, this is supposed to be very nourishing</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: On 13th day there is <em>Chauka Charhna</em> celebration,
                the day when she is allowed in the kitchen. They make panjiri , a powdery stuff
                made out of flour, sugar and <i>Ghee</i>. First flour is lightly roasted in <i>Ghee</i>.
                Then it is taken off the fire and 32 ingredients are added into it: raisins, magaz
                (seeds of watermelon) almonds, cashew, <em>gondh, ajwain, supari, kamarkas, haraj, makhane,
                    kali mirch </em>(pepper) coconut and other things. This, the woman takes for
                30 days. It is important to build extra strength for both mother and the baby who
                is having breast milk. It is hot food and it helps in cleaning out the dirty blood.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Veena: Do you give her water after delivery?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We tell her to take less water otherwise her stomach
                bloats and for 40 days she should be given lukewarm water.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Veena: Any special instructions for bathing?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Yes, we always give her a nice massage before her
                bath and this is done for at least 40 days. Some families do not allow her to rest
                for 40 days then she starts her work after 13 days. If there is no woman to take
                care of the family then she is back to work on the second day. This is not good.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: I have seen some women eating mud after their delivery</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Veena: Why do they eat mud?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: This urge may be because of lack of blood. Then we
                ask her to have curd and fruits.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: These days we hear of babies having <em>piliya</em>
                (yellowish, jaundice) after birth. This reflects on the weak constitution of the
                mother. If she takes proper food then baby will be healthy and will not catch any
                infections.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We tell them not to eat mud as this can harm her
                blood circulation, bones and her health. Instead they can have roasted black gram
                or lentils, popcorns or groundnuts. But sometimes the urge to have mud is so strong
                that they hide and eat it.</span></p>

            Evening Session
            <br />
            <span class="lrgtxt2">Interview of 2 <i>dais</i>: Harbans Kaur &amp; Swaran Kaur</span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Two <i>dais</i> stayed overnight with us in the <i>Gurdwara </i>
                . Both were widows and were living with their sons. The sons allowed them to stay
                out for the night as their wives were there to take care of the household. Moreover,
                they said that since their husbands were no longer alive they did not need anybody's
                permission. For them it was a great opportunity to be at Fatehgarh <i>Gurdwara </i>
                and have food served at the <i>langar</i> (community kitchen). Both <i>dais</i>
                were <i>Mazhabi</i>Sikhs. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">They were both friends but hardly got any opportunity to meet
                each other. This was also a chance for them to be together. They were <i>laug hing</i>
                and talking to each other and were very friendly with us. We interviewed them together.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur [In this interview, perhaps unconsciously counter
                balancing the workshop focus on birth, we talk about death.]</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: I have five sons. They work on daily wages. They
                look after other people's animals, clean them and feed them. In return for our service,
                we get food, clothes, grains but no money. We are low caste people (<em>Chamars</em>),
                and are referred to as Balmikis. We work for fixed homes (<em>jajmans</em>). Our
                grandfathers also worked in these houses. At times we are called by Nai (barbers)
                or <em>Brahmins</em> (priestly caste), to do domestic work. The high caste <i>Zamindars
                </i>(landowners) do not allow us to enter their homes and kitchens. We cannot eat
                from their utensils.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: Do they give money or special gifts on festivals?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: No money is given. They give us clothes, grains
                and food. On <i>Lohri</i> (festival) they give us clothes and fruits.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: In case of financial need does zamindar give money?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: He gives money on 10% interest. Even if somebody
                is on their death bed he will not lend without interest.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">There is a festival called <em>Chakkarian</em>, when we go to
                the houses that we work for and wish and bless them and in return they give us food
                and clothes.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: Where did you learn <i>Dai </i>work?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: From my <em>Bua</em>, who did <i>Dai</i>work. I
                used to go with her. I learnt <i>Dai </i>work in my Sasural and I was about 35.
                Then I got a chance to do a course in my village, Gauran. My first child was born
                in 1947 during the Partition. I was 22.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: What was Partition like for you?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: There were riots, killing, violence everywhere,
                we hid where we could. It was in this chaos that I had my first baby. There was
                panic every where. Hindus were killing Muslims in Roza Sharif (a <em>dargah</em>
                next to Fatehgarh Saheb) and Muslims were killing Hindus in Lahore.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: How did Hindus kill Muslims in Roza Sharif? Did Hindus
                and Sikhs kill together?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: Yes, actually this was the reaction to the killing
                of Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: It must have been very difficult for women of all communities
                Hindu, Sikh or Muslim. History only talks about the hardships that men faced. Would
                you tell us the difficulties that women faced?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: Nobody was concerned about the other person. Everyone
                was busy saving themselves. No one cared about their sisters or mothers. Only the
                mothers were trying to save their children, hiding them in fields or where ever
                they could. The wells were full of women's dead bodies. They killed themselves because
                of the fear of rape or assault. Nobody was safe--even the army personnel got injured
                and killed. It was very frightening </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: In 1984 when anti-Sikh riots took place, about 5,000 people
                were killed. They say the majority of them were Dalits, <i>Mazhabi</i>Sikh.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: I have not heard much about 1984 anti-Sikh riots
                as there is not much discussion in the village but I know when she (Indira Gandhi)
                came back from her tour, the enemies were already waiting for her. They shot her,
                she screamed but could not be saved. These men were from the low caste because they
                were the ones who got tempted by the money paid to them and once you accept the
                money, you have to do the job.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: When people die do you believe they become spirits, especially
                when they have unnatural death?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: We do not believe in <i>bhoot-pret </i>(spirits)
                but people in villages do believe and go about getting village remedies like <i>jhar-phook</i>
                (getting a shaman to do magical rites). </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: It is said that when a pregnant woman dies she becomes
                an evil spirit </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: Yes it can trouble people. It can enter inside living
                people and it can enter in different people at its will. Once I was a victim of
                a bad spirit and I had to go to a <i>pir</i> (a Muslim religious person who cures
                these cases) then it got into my sister-in law's body. Then this spirit killed its
                own four children.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: Did you personally know this woman?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: Yes, she was my neighbor.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: Is there any special means by which you can prevent the
                <i>churail</i>(female evil spirit)?<br />
                Harbans Kaur: Yes, we put nails around her place of cremation. The <i>pir</i> also
                reads out the <i>Kalam </i>(prayers from the Quran) and stops the spirit from becoming
                evil.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: You also throw mustard seeds while taking her dead body.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: Mustard seeds hurt the eyes so we believe that it
                will make it difficult for her to see anything.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: You say that her hands and feet are <em>ulta</em> (turned
                in). Have you seen anyone in real life like this?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: No, we have only heard of these things never seen
                anyone in reality. We call the turned legs <i>Putpair</i> (one with reversed legs
                or legs backward). We have seen things like putting nails around the cremation place
                to ward off spirits.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: This neighbor who died, did her husband remarry?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: No, he did not, because he was scared, especially
                after the death of his four children.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: When a woman dies due to poison or violence or suicide
                do they become evil spirits?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: Yes, they do.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: When low caste young people die are they cremated or buried
                facing down, the belief that then they will not come back as evil spirits?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Harbans Kaur: No, we do not do this. It is done amongst Muslims.
                They first put earthen vessels, then the dead body facing down, salt and then it
                is covered with mud.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">The migrants just let the dead body float in the streams saying
                that it will be eaten by fishes and turtles but we cremate the dead.</span></p>
        <p class="lrgtxt2">
            Swaran Kaur</p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Swaran Kaur: I have 2 daughters, 2 sons and 3 grandsons. One son
                is not married. Nobody in my family has taken <i>Dai</i>work neither my daughters
                nor daughters-in law.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">The first child that I helped deliver is a policeman now. He lives
                in the neighborhood and touches my feet whenever he sees me and calls me <i>Bibi</i>
                respectfully. We are all from the labour class and do not get any money. We are
                given only food and clothes and 10 rupees for the birth of a male child. Actually
                the work of a <i>Dai </i>involves lot of work: cleaning, washing dirty clothes,
                staying up long hours with the woman and attending to her. The younger generation
                is not ready to put up with this sort of work. They find it messy and smelly. My
                daughter-in-law finds it dirty and does not want to take it up.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: Why do you call the blood after childbirth <i>ganda khoon
            </i>(dirty blood)?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Swaran Kaur: Because it is collected over nine months in the body.
                It is dark coloured, smelly and clotted. It comes out first and then the fresh clean
                blood comes out.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: But it brings new life so the blood should not be called
                dirty.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Swaran Kaur: With the baby comes out water and some blood, then
                the placenta comes out followed by clotted blood and then the clean red blood comes
                out.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Renuka: In Bihar the <i>dais</i> called these clots <em>Gangi-Jamuni</em>.
                They said that once the clots are out the body gets cleansed and the woman feels
                good.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Swaran Kaur: Yes, this should come out or else it can harm her
                body.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: So, what do you do to take it out completely?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Swaran Kaur: Usually it comes out on its own with the <i>anwal</i>.
                With a little massage and pressure, we assist the mother to take it out completely,
                and when the colour of the blood becomes clear like the monthly cycle we believe
                that it is clean.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: How many births have you attended?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Swaran Kaur: Must be between fifty and sixty. I go to two villages-Bhangwa
                and Manjari.<br />
                Janet: Do you go to <i>Zamindars </i>&#8217; houses?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Swaran Kaur: Yes, whoever calls us we go. Sometimes, also to the
                very poor living by the roadside. We do not take anything from them. This is our
                way, doing service, we do it free.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: Do you guide young girls if they have questions regarding
                menses?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Swaran Kaur: No, these days girls do not consult <i>dais</i>.
                They talk to their sisters or Bhabhi, but not mothers. They usually turn to people
                of their own age. The sister-in-law drops hints to the mother, like, they say, now
                our girl has become healthy and grown up and has started washing clothes &quot;<em>kapre
                    dhon lag gai hai</em>&quot;. There is no direct communication between mother
                and daughter on this matter. Then the mother becomes careful and keeps a watch over
                her daughter. The daughter is not allowed to go out alone, she is always accompanied
                by her Bhabhi or someone. She does not have the freedom of childhood.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: This is the way of broadening relationships between women,
                besides the mother there are other support figures like sisters-in law and aunts.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Swaran Kaur: We try to build a closer relationship with our daughters-in-law
                as daughters will go away but we have to live with our sons and their wives.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: During periods girls were not allowed to enter the kitchen

                Chhati</em> (or <em>Chauka Charhana</em>, as you say in Punjab) is considered like
                being in narak and both the woman and the <i>Dai</i>went through it together so
                on Chhati they both dressed up like brides. Do you follow this custom?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>dais</i>: No, not really. The <i>Dai</i> helps her by cleaning
                her clothes and by massaging her.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: In hospitals there is no close interaction between the

                close, they share pain and happiness together. Does a <i>Dai </i>get the same attention
                from the family also?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>dais</i>: She only gets food and clothes but no money is given.</span></p>

            <span class="default"><i>dais</i>: We try not to let people from our villages go to

                and go to the doctors. </span>

                <br />
                Renuka: Sometimes after birth there is uncontrolled excessive bleeding, and it doesn't
                stop.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>dais</i>: This happens when the uterus does not close. Sometimes
                when they put too much pressure, then there is a possibility of having excessive
                bleeding. But these are rare cases. She should be given <em>teeka</em> (injection)
                for it.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Balwant Kaur: When she has her first baby, the mother's body is
                stronger, younger and more healthy, so the deliveries are generally not complicated.
                Bleeding usually happens after the third child because she has less energy and less
                blood in her body. Sometimes we also call the doctor if we cannot handle it. We
                do not put mother's life at risk. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kartar Kaur: in case of slight bleeding we make the foot side
                of the bed higher, remove the pillows. This also lessens the bleeding. We make her
                lie down, raise her legs by putting four-five bricks under her feet and remove the
                pillow from her head. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: During the fag end of the bleeding, we gently massage
                the stomach, so that if there are any clots left, they also flow out.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Renuka: Do you do something if the labour is taking long because
                the cervix is not opening?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>dais</i>: We warm up <i>Ghee</i> or coconut oil and then with
                cotton apply it very slowly on the <em>sharir </em>(vagina). This softens it. We
                do not do this many times as becomes<em> jahar </em>(poisonous&#8212;cause infection).
                It swells if we apply it with unclean hands or if we apply it many times.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">If, after labour, the woman faces problems in passing urine or
                she has swelling then we put Dettol in warm water and wash her <em>sharir</em> (vagina)
                with cotton. We do this very gently. We also make her squat on the brick and ask
                her to wash her vagina with warm water. We also do this for her.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Surjeet Kaur: These days there are too many diseases .In olden
                days, <i>dais</i> used to rub their hands with ashes and then cut the <i>naal </i>
                but these days we have to wash our hands so many times. In earlier days, when the
                mother or the baby developed cold or cough, we made karha (concentrated herb tea)
                and gave it to them to drink. Now we depend so much on injections for all types
                of infections.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kako: Everything has changed. These days they use fertilisers
                in the fields, spray the fields and this has a very bad effect on health, especially
                on women's health. With this the rats, snakes and all kinds of insects die so it
                has an affect on grains and this in turn affects our body and the baby also.<br />
                Surjeet Kaur: Before, people used cow dung as manure and therefore we used to get
                pure grains.
                <br />
                Satya: For cough we used to give honey or <i>ajwain</i> for the child. These days,
                injections are given the moment a woman gets pregnant and is asked to take rest.
                Sometimes, if the mother is weak, we also suggest bed rest. She stops doing heavy
                physical work. I used to grind 20 kg of wheat on my own even during pregnancy. But
                times have changed. People are not so strong now.<br />
                Surjeet Kaur: When I was pregnant then I used to knit <i>Charpoy</i> (cot) with
                ropes, grind flour and lentils up till the time of delivery.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kako: Even in this old age I can walk for 40 miles but my daughter-in-law
                cannot walk this much. These days, people consume tea and that has made them too
                weak. In our time, people used to have black grams and <i>lassi</i> (drink made
                out of curd and water). People used to <em>carry chana</em>and <em>gur</em> (black
                gram and jaggery) to fields and eat.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Now they get tired of the routine cooking and cleaning;
                any extra work and they start grumbling.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>dais</i>: Some women are weak because they are anaemic and
                this can also lead to death.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Renuka: Is it because of a different diet?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kartar Kaur: Sometime it is because of a different lifestyle.
                Nobody wants to work hard. Also, the diet has changed. We did not eat much, but
                whatever we had was pure and good. We would be doing our work and having roasted
                gram or wheat. Women should have green vegetables and soaked grams.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Renuka: How do you make out that she has shortage of blood?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Satya: Her hands look pale, she feels dizzy, her arms ache, her
                legs feel weak and she has problems in moving around.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Renuka: What do you do for swelling?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kako: In this situation woman does not feel like working and she
                feels like lying down all the time.<br />
                Sharifan: You have swelling if you have sugar problem.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Satya: A woman gets swelling if she is weak. She vomits during
                labour. The child takes whatever nourishment it requires but it is the woman who
                suffers so we suggest that she should consume green vegetables and soaked gram.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kako: If she has swollen feet, then we massage her feet. This
                helps in the circulation of blood. We ask her to improve her diet. We tell her to
                sleep with her feet raised. We also pray to God and ask for help in our work and
                not to bring disgrace to our work. When we start our work we first take the name
                of <i>Sachhey Badshah </i>(term used to address God), asking him for protection
                and only breathe a sigh of relief after the birth. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kartar Kaur: We do not eat anything till the birth of the baby,
                we do not even have tea. We feel relaxed only after we see that the mother and child
                are fine. It is only then that we feel like bathing, changing and eating.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Renuka: Many women get a shock after the birth of a girl child.
                Can this lead to problems?<br />
                Kako: We do not tell the woman about the sex of the child because the shock may
                cause the <i>anwal</i> (placenta) to get sucked up into the body and this may cause
                death. We try to remain calm and also keep the woman calm. We wait for the <i>anwal</i>
                to come out, cut the <i>naal </i>and then tell her. This may happen even in excitement
                or if the woman is too happy over the birth of a boy child. We do not even tell
                the members of the family about it. It is only after cutting the <i>naal </i>and
                after attending to the mother and child that we inform everyone.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: In one situation, a woman had a fourth girl child.
                And she was very upset. I told her not to worry as otherwise I would take her baby
                and bring her up. This gave her a lot of support and strength. This role too, is
                played by the <i>Dai </i>.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Renuka: A <i>Dai </i>has an added responsibility of managing the
                woman and also her family.<br />
                Veena: What do you do if there is a miscarriage?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kako: If the patient is weak, overworked and starts bleeding then
                she aborts and we cannot do anything about it.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Sometimes due to some tension or pressure, there
                is spotting. Then we give her dry food. She is not given <i>Ghee</i> or milk and
                she is asked to have light food only. We give her light tea. We also tell her to
                take bed rest and sleep with her feet raised.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Renuka: Tell us something about the birth positions?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Balwant Kaur: For first baby we ask a woman to squat.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kako: For third and fourth baby we ask her to lie down during
                birth though the pain is as much as the first baby if not less.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kako: To set the uterus a <i>Dai </i>presses the woman's perineum
                with her heels. The uterus tries to come out because it is looking for the baby
                that it was carrying so we have to press it. Before this we press her stomach so
                that all the dirty blood comes out. First the dark coloured blood, <i>ganda khoon </i>
                , comes out then it becomes clean red. This means all the clots and dirty blood
                has come out. We take all this and bury it. This makes her feel good otherwise she
                gets pain in her stomach.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Renuka: Why are you so particular about taking out this <i>ganda
                khoon </i>and clots? Is it harmful for her? </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kako: Yes, if the clots are re<i>Tai </i>ned then it can lead
                to the death of the woman or she may go insane. A woman complains that there is
                a <i>gola</i>, some round thing that&#8217;s moving around and she feels uneasy.
                She howls and cries. So we press her stomach and the dirty blood comes out.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: If we feel that all the dirty blood is not out then
                we gently massage the stomach down ward with warm oil. Then whatever is left comes
                out. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Renuka: In Bihar they call these clots <i>Gangi Jamuni </i>and
                say that after it is out women feels good and light.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Veena: How do you massage the stomach after delivery?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We wait for the placenta to come out and then after
                15-20 minutes do circular massage on the stomach. This relaxes and softens the stomach
                and helps clear the clots.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Gurmail Kaur: If the placenta is re<i>Tai </i>ned then one should
                massage the woman's stomach with <i>ajwain</i> mixed in mustard oil. This warms
                up the stomach and after 20-30 minutes the placenta comes out.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kartar Kaur: If the placenta is re<i>Tai </i>ned then we roll
                the <i>naal </i>in our index finger and very slowly twist it and pull it out.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Sharifan: With our other hand we also press her stomach.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Balwant Kaur: After delivery I go home, bathe, change my clothes
                and then go for the next delivery. If the death of a baby takes place, than we first
                clean the place, wash and clean the mother and also change and wash ourselves. It
                is considered a bad omen to work again without bathing and cleaning. This is called
                <i>suthak</i>. [Although <i>suthak</i> is described here as relating to the death
                of a child, it actually per<i>Tai </i>ns to all births, the pollution or untouchability
                of mother and <i>Dai </i>. Perhaps its mention here has to do with the possibility
                of death at the time of birth.]</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: People fear that death would follow and it may happen
                in their house too. Parchhain na lag jaye (shadow of death may fall on them).</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Renuka: In case of some complication do you call a doctor for
                help?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: I have never called a doctor. I give injections myself.
                To hasten delivery I give injection, if pains become less and are at long intervals.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We have a doctor in our village and he tells us what
                injection to give. He is better equipped. He has a fridge and keeps these injections.
                We get it from him whenever the need arises.<br />
                Renuka: Where did you learn to give injections? </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We were taught in our training but we do not know
                the name of these injections. However, it is a rare situation and most of the deliveries
                are normal and then we do not have to use <i>Angrezi</i> (literally, English--western)
                medicine.</span></p>

                this topic because it reflected the obsession with having a boy, but without any
                success. She then intervened, one of the few times in the entire Matrika process

                    that this knowledge is only used in getting a male child. If your traditional knowledge
                    on this subject of the cycles of the moon is used only in this way then we will
                    not discuss it further. Are you not concerned with the welfare of girls and women?
                    I guess not because we women ourselves are obsessed with the boy child. We cannot

                it if it is a female child. [The <i>dais</i> make the connection between the overwhelming
                desire for a male child and what they, in their hearts, know to be a wrong practice.

        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>dais</i>: We take <i>Ghee</i> or <i>sarson ka tel </i>(mustard
                oil) and massage legs, knee and feet. We massage in the upward direction, from the
                feet to the thighs. This helps in the circulation of the blood. After massage one
                should wait for at least two hours and then have a bath. We also rub hands and legs
                with a copper utensil. After the baby is born then we massage the head because head
                can catch cold. We take slightly warm oil to massage the head and body.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kishwar: You massage the head everyday?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Yes, we massage her for 40 days, sometimes we heat
                <i>badam roghan </i>(almonds) in the oil and massage her head with this oil. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We also do fomentation of the vagina (<i>takor sek</i>).
                In warm water we put some Dettol, if we don&#8217;t have Dettol, then we use <i>ajwain</i>
                water (boil <i>ajwain</i> in water). With cotton or clean cloth we give fomentation
                and also put gentle pressure to settle the uterus</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Priya: What do you do during pregnancy, any special massage before
                the baby comes out?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: No, there is nothing. We only massage after the baby
                is born that too from the second day of delivery.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Priya: What about backache, do you do massage for that?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Massage for backache is also after delivery or during
                labour when she complains that her back is paining then we press her back to comfort
                her. During labour we also press and rub the inner side of her thighs, this is also
                very comforting. We do not use oil at this time.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: If at the time of delivery the baby moves, we position
                it by massaging.. If the baby is in a low position in the womb then with the help
                of special massage we can push it up otherwise the baby is delivered before time.

                at a particular place, it usually happens if the baby moves to a <i>breech </i>position.
                Then we give her massage.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We move our hands in the upward direction. This helps
                in the circulation of the blood. Both sweat, one who is doing and one who is getting
                it done. You should wait for at least two hours for the body to cool and then bathe.</span></p>

            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Yes, with a copper bowl we rub the sole and palms
                and it becomes warm. This is not done for pregnant women but is done in general
                massage.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: If a pregnant woman complains of backache or says
                that she has pains in the rectum than she is made to sit on a <i>gilas</i> (glass
                with wide bottom is used), placed upside down. This helps to push the baby back
                into place.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Priya: These are pressure points, which help to push the uterus.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: If a baby of 6-12 months does not take milk and is
                vomiting, then we take ash mix it with <i>Ghee</i> or oil and massage the back of
                the neck, chest and ankles.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: For curing loose motions they smear dry powder of
                pomegranate skin on the palate.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: If the baby is in <i>terha</i> (<i>breech </i>) position
                than at times with massage it can be moved. For this we use <i>Ghee</i>. Back massage
                is very essential in <i>breech </i>cases.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: After the baby is born we bathe the baby with special
                warm water, which is prepared by boiling methi (fenugreek) in it. <i>ajwain</i>
                seeds are burnt in the room where mother and child stay. The smoke is considered
                a disinfectant. If baby develops an upset stomach then saunf (fennel seeds) are
                boiled in water and few spoons of this water is given to the baby. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">If the mother feels uneasy these days it is said that it is caused
                by high blood pressure but earlier we used to say that there is <i>hawa</i> in the
                upper portion of the body. Due to this uneasiness the mother would sometimes hit
                the <i>Dai </i>but we understood that she is feeling uneasy.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Babies should not be kept on the lap too often as
                this hampers growth. Milk is very essential but it is not given immediately after
                the birth but after a day or so.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: If a girl is born then we do not tell the woman immediately
                since she might feel upset and harm herself but even at the birth of a son we do
                not inform her as too much of excitement may also be harmful. We gently press the
                new mother&#8217;s hands and feet. The gentle pressure on the whole body is very
                comforting. It is also good for the joints as the bones get weak after pregnancy.
                The stomach massage is done anticlockwise.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kishwar: Do you feel that after delivery the woman's behaviour
                becomes erratic? Sometimes she is very happy and sometimes very sad.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: In villages they say upari <i>hawa</i><em> lag gayi
                hai</em> (effect of evil spirits&#8212;or literally upward wind is affecting her).
                This kind of explanation is given by illiterate people. But in reality this is the
                effect of blood pressure, high or low. She cries, tears her clothes and hits people
                around her. Sometimes her hands and legs twist, face becomes red and she gets very
                aggressive. She complains of head ache, sinking feeling and has swollen legs.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Sometimes, the baby develops <em>piliya </em>(jaundice)
                or the baby is born blue-then people say it is due to<em> upari kasar ho gayi hai</em>
                (kasar-lack). This means lack of blood, nutrition or attention. If there is deficiency
                of blood or the baby and the mother's blood group is different then it may cause
                the baby to be born blue.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kishwar: What do you do if the baby is blue?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We clean and wash the baby and put it beside the
                mother. The baby becomes all right in about 10 minutes.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Sometimes we have to take the baby to the hospital.
                On one occasion, we took a baby who was given injections every day. Each injection
                was for Rs.200.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kishwar: Do you have any home remedy?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: If the baby gets jaundice, we keep giving water mixed
                with salt and sugar. If the baby is weak, then we put it out in the sun. Even the
                doctors in the hospital say that the sun is good for the babies.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: In doing so, the pores of the skin open and make
                the baby very active.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kishwar: Do you feel that women are moving away from breast feeding?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Yes, but only women who go out to work. Actually,
                when the mother starts feeding the baby, the bond of love is formed between mother
                and child.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kishwar: When a woman starts crying or feels uneasy, is there
                any special <i>maalish</i>?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We give her some warm milk, and gently press her
                body.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: One of my patients, in a fit of anger, once bit me
                and I slapped her! Another patient kicked me right on my chest and for two days,
                I could not get up; some pull my hair. To such women who are uncontrollable, I am
                forced to give a tight slap.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kishwar: Is there no role of <i>maalish</i>in this condition?</span></p>

            <span class="default">Kishwar: She may be pulling your hair or hitting you because of
                unbearable pain while having a baby?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: No, this is because of high blood pressure and she
                is doing this because she is restless and agitated. If she has a sinking feeling,
                then we give her some lukewarm milk with some tea leaves in it. Sometimes with worry
                and anxiety, she starts bleeding too much and at that time, we have to give her
                Calmpose injections.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Kishwar: How does <i>maalish</i>help?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: The body becomes light and relieves fatigue. Without
                massage, she does not become active. It helps to firm up the muscles.</span></p>

            </span><span class="default">
                <br />
                Manmohan Sharma: We would like you to think carefully and then give your opinions
                and suggestions regarding this workshop. Would you like some changes?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We appreciate this effort of reaching out to us and
                sharing our experiences. We feel that you have asked a lot about us and our work
                but did not tell us much about your work and knowledge. Sometimes when we go to
                the hospital nurses treat us very shabbily. When we take a complicated case then
                they say that we spoil the case and then bring it to the hospital. They do not appreciate
                the fact that we <i>dais</i> also handle quite a few cases ourselves.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We are not paid any money for our work. We feel that
                people like you should speak and represent us. We should be given a fixed amount
                of money. Since there is no money given by the government even for the small expenses
                incurred by us like for the kit.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: If we are better equipped and respected by society
                then naturally the village folk will come to us for deliveries and not go out.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We would like some sort of training in our profession;
                some of us have done courses and got kits also but no certificates. Sometimes this
                is a hindrance.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We get no financial aid only get paid in kind for
                our services. We are therefore dependent on family members for our work.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We are very happy with our work but we get no support
                from the government.
                <br />
                Manmohan Sharma: As for your suggestion for training we need to organise groups
                of 25-30 people at least. If you give us names and addresses we can plan for training
                programs. We can then request the state to issue I-cards to the <i>dais</i>, pay
                them a regular stipend of approximately 500 rupees per month for service to society.
                We all need to work together to promote this <i>Dai </i>work.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We like this exchange of ideas and interaction between
                us. We want to know did you like our work?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Janet: Yes, we are doing research on the work of <i>dais</i> all
                over the country and want to present this to the government and tell them what invaluable
                work they are doing to the society. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: Sometimes a full term baby dies during childbirth.
                How do we handle such cases?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Dr Tulika: We suggest that they go for check-ups for at least
                three times during pregnancy. First, when they miss their periods, then in the end
                of three months. If need be, they should take injections in the fourth and fifth
                month. Prevent them from getting any infection. In case of high fever no such medicines
                should be given as it may harm the baby.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: We also ask the woman to get her blood pressure checked.
                Some suffer from sugar problem, so we have to be careful about it. Dehydration can
                also affect the baby, suk janda hai (the baby also gets dehydrated)</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Dr Tulika: Sometimes if there is too much fluid then too the baby
                is affected. It may not have proper growth. This can also lead to death or premature
                birth.</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default"><i>Dai </i>: If the pregnancy is full term and the pains do not
                start then what does one do?</span></p>
        <p class="default">
            <span class="default">Dr Tulika: If the water bag is intact and the baby&#8217;s movement
                is fine then wait for few days.<br />

                and to the point rather than lengthy and discursive. They are sung at the women&#8217;s
