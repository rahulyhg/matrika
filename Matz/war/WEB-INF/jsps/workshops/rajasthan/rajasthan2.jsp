        <span class="default">Madhu: We were very happy with the workshop we conducted with
            you the last time. We really appreciate the information you shared with us. On our
            return, when we started reading through the notes we had made and began working
            on the report, we realised once again that you have a special skill that other people
            don&#8217;t have. When we talk with you here, we are not able to appreciate the
            full significance of all the things you tell us. When we look through, peacefully,
            at all the material you have given us during our discussion, we find so much more
            in it. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">We feel that a lot of the information that was generated in the
            sessions is deeply rooted in your traditions. The doctors do not have this knowledge.
            It is you all, the <i>dais</i>, who have had a tradition of assisting in deliveries.
            Gradually, the doctors have been taking over this area of your practice. Janet began
            this research on the <i>dais</i>&#8217; system of childbirth, in order to understand
            and validate your knowledge, your skills and practices. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Janet: When we came the last time, it was extremely hot. Then
            we sat and worked together. We are also working in four other places. We have seen
            one good thing emerge from our talks as well as discussions with others too, that
            you all have many practices in common. Hence, we can work with such valuable material
            we have received from you all.</span></p>
    <p align="justify" class="smltxt">
        The <i>dais</i> who were not present for the earlier workshop introduced themselves.</p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Teeja: My mother used to do <em>dai</em> work. I used to be with
            my mother when she assisted in <i>japa s</i> and listen to her experiences especially
            about the problems she faced when the <i>anwal </i>did not come out. When my brother
            got married I watched the <i>japa </i>of my sister-in-law. I held her <i>paet</i>
            and my mother told me not to hold her legs together. Just then the <i>anwal </i>
            came out. Very gradually, I learnt this work. Then I joined this organisation and
            I was given a month&#8217;s training to learn how to recognise and handle some difficult
            cases. When we cannot handle any complication we tell them to take the case to the
            hospital. We also learnt how to examine the growth of the baby in the mother&#8217;s
            <i>paet</i>. If there is a problem of the <i>anwal </i>not coming out (placenta
            retention) we learnt how to handle this. They also gave us a test after the training.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Nanu: I was16 years old and my mother was still having babies
            at that time. When my mother was going to have a baby she called me and asked me
            to hold her <i>paet</i> and the baby was born immediately. After that I started
            assisting in births. I was given training by the organisation. Earlier, we used
            to cut the <i>naal </i>with a knife. Now we don&#8217;t use a knife. We also learnt
            about medicines. A doctor from Udaipur had come and he asked me about the different
            medicines and what is given for different ailments. I told him and he thanked me.
            Earlier we used to do <em>stanpaan</em> (breastfeed) after two-three days but now
            we tell them to do it straight after the baby is born. If we have problems or complications
            in a delivery case and we feel we cannot handle it, we send the case to Lunkaransar.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Saraswati: We give black <em>gur</em>, <em>ajwain</em> and <em>
            jaiphal</em> when the labour pains begin. I have learnt all this from my mother.
            From the age of fifteen years, I have been assisting in childbirth cases. Not one
            of these cases has gone wrong. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Revati: I have learnt this work only after joining the organisation.
            Our village is very big where the <i>dais</i> are not very clean in their work.
            Now I tell them everything about cleanliness. </span>

    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Badu: I don&#8217;t do <i>japas </i>but I have been doing the
            work of giving medicines for thirteen years. I only help out when there are complications.
            I also give immunization for the babies. When there are complications, people come
            to me. If the pregnant woman has any swelling or any other problems I do the work
            of referring them to the hospital. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Teeja: My Dadi and my mother used to do <i>japa </i>work. I have
            learnt the work from them. Until now, I have not had any serious complication in
            any <i>japa </i>.Now I am part of this organisation. I give warm milk and ajwain
            still. We don&#8217;t give much of <em>lawang</em> (cloves). We give ajwain and
            gur. There is no danger if you give this. Even ghee is given. If lawang is given,
            it makes the woman sweat and then if she is exposed to any breeze, it can cause
            problems. Or, sometimes, <i>brahme ki goli </i>is given. I have conducted <i>ulta bacha
            </i>deliveries. By working our hands on the <i>paet</i>, we are able to make the
            baby <i>seedha</i>. Now, we also give iron injections.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Sarbati: I first started working when Sanjayji asked me to. I
            would assist in childbirth, help in cutting the <i>naal </i>but I do not clean the
            clothes. Sometimes, the woman&#8217;s family is stubborn and we have to end up conducting
            the birth on the way itself.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Rukma: My mother used to assist in childbirth. Once, I assisted
            in a <i>japa </i>in a Rajput family, the baby came out okay but I didn&#8217;t know
            how to handle the removal of the <i>anwal </i>. I told them very clearly that I
            could not handle it. Then another woman took out the placenta. Later, that woman
            told my mother that I didn&#8217;t know how to take out the <i>anwal </i>. I also
            felt bad about it. Then my mother taught me how to remove the <i>anwal </i>. She
            also taught me how to manipulate an <i>ulta bacha </i>by doing <i>maalish </i>and
            make it <i>seedha</i>. I learnt how to assist in childbirth at the age of thirty.
            I have been involved in this organisation for the past thirteen years. </span>

    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Renuka: Today we would like to talk about how body substances
            are used for medicinal purposes. Like, my mother used to tell us that if you get
            ulcers in the mouth, a little application of menstrual blood on them helps to heal
            them. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Guddi: After the baby is born, if a menstruating woman comes near
            the newborn, it will get sores all over the body. Also, if <i>foos </i>(hay) is
            used for burning the <i>chullah </i>near the baby, it will be affected with sores
            on his body. Then if we bathe the baby with it&#8217;s mother&#8217;s menstrual
            blood, it becomes all right. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Sharbati: A sensible woman will not go near a baby if she is menstruating.
            If such a woman goes near a baby, it can even cause the death of the baby. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Pema: For ten days after its birth, until the baby has been taken
            out, it is believed to be in danger. Once the name has been decided on, it is considered
            safe from any harm.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Bhagwan Kaur: If the baby is made to lick a little blood from
            the <i>anwal </i>, we believe that the baby will never get <i>uparla </i>(pneumonia).</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Renuka: If the child is very weak, then how do you do <i>anwal
            sootna </i>(how to revive the baby)?</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Rukma: If the baby does not breathe soon after birth, we <i>thapthapao
        </i>(gently pat) the baby. Such a baby is usually blue in colour. We give mouth-to-mouth
            respiration. If even that doesn&#8217;t help to revive the child, we work very hard
            to save the baby. We rack our brains as to what to do. We put the <i>anwal </i>in
            warm water and this usually brings life into the baby.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Shanti: How long do you wait to do all this treatment? </span>

            anwal </i>in warm water to revive a baby?</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Rukma: In our village, in Vairagi&#8217;s place, a woman gave
            birth to twins. One was able to breathe soon after its birth but the other was not
            able to breathe. Then I put the <i>anwal </i>into warm water and the second baby
            also began to breathe. That baby survived. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Shanti: What was the colour of the baby?</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Rukma: That baby was totally blue, the one that had not been able
            to breathe. The other one was quite <i>dhola</i> (fair).</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Renuka: Will some of the others also relate your experiences?
        </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Teeja: Immediately after the baby is born, if it doesn&#8217;t
            breathe, we <i>thapthapate hain </i>(pat it). By doing this, water comes out from
            the baby&#8217;s mouth and nose and the baby is able to breathe. When the baby is
            not breathing, its lips and feet become blue. So we try to give <i>phoonk</i> (blow
            into its mouth). This also helps the baby to breathe. If it is still not breathing,
            we clean its nose and ears and blow strongly into its mouth. This usually helps
            the baby to breathe.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">One woman gave birth to her baby in the seventh month. I was called
            to assist in the delivery. When I touched her stomach, I felt it was very round.
            Anyway, after a while, the baby was born. It came out with a lot of force and was
            like a round <i>lota </i>shaped mass of flesh. It was covered in a <i>jhilli </i>
            (caul). It didn&#8217;t look like a baby. It looked like a <i>lota </i>. Her grandmother
            was sitting there. She said that whatever had to happen, had happened and asked
            me to go and throw the mass of flesh. She brought me a <i>matki </i>(earthenware
            pot) and asked me to put it in the <i>matki </i>and throw it. I said I didn&#8217;t
            want to throw it, and I wanted to tear the caul and see. She asked why I wanted
            to do that and dirty the place and dirty my hands. I said I didn&#8217;t mind as
            this was my regular work. I tore the caul and found a small little baby. It was
            red in colour. It&#8217;s <i>anwal naal </i>had dried up inside and so the baby
            hadn&#8217;t been able to grow very big. The ears and nose were properly developed.
            The caul was white in colour. Along with the caul some white water had also come
            out. I said this is a baby boy. I took him into my hands and breathed out forcefully
            into his mouth. The baby opened his mouth a little and I saw a little water come
            out. Slowly, he was able to breathe properly. After an hour or so, I cut the cord.
            I had some water boiled and cooled. I gave the baby water, drop by drop. Gradually,
            he got life into him. I wrapped it up well in some cloth. I didn&#8217;t bathe it.
            In some warm water, I wet some cloth and sponged the baby well. I cleaned his ears
            and nose. Now the baby has grown quite big. Come, I will take you to that baby.
            You can go and check how true my story is. Now the child says he is mine. When his
            <i>Nana </i>and <i>Nani </i>came for his naming ceremony with clothes as gifts,
            all those clothes were given to me. They said that I was the real mother because
            I had breathed life into him and revived him. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Renuka: We see that you did two things. You gave it your breath,
            that is <i>hawa </i>and you gave it water. These are the two things, which give
            life. The <em>dai</em> understands the body and what it needs. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Dai: If the baby is weak, sometimes the lungs are not able to
            function properly so it is not able to breathe. When we blow our breath into them,
            the walls of the lungs open and it is able to function. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Teeja: I neither had a blade nor any thread. I had just come to
            check on the stomach. It was the seventh month. I said this baby has come down and
            it will fall out this way. We should wet a cloth with warm water and wipe the baby.
            We should not bathe it. I have never received any training. All this I know from
            my <em>dimaag</em> (mind, brain). We should give the baby 250gm. water. This was
            providence telling me what to do. That baby survived because of this. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Shanti: You tell me what all does one have to do to bring life
            back into the baby? Where did you get this knowledge to breathe life into the baby
            and to give it water drop by drop? </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Teeja: I can only say that providence helped me to do what I did.
            That if I blow my breath into the baby he will begin to breathe. And when I saw
            the baby move a little I felt I should give the baby a few drops of water. I kept
            giving it drops of water and kept blowing into the baby. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Sharbati: In the village they say that the doctor comes once and
            goes away. You are our Ram.
            <br />
            Renuka: We have also heard that the caul is a very lucky thing.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Rukma: A premature baby&#8217;s caul is blue and very thick. A
            healthy, full grown baby&#8217;s caul is white and very thin. In the hospital they
            refer to the caul as <em>tind</em> .</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Renuka: Isn&#8217;t it also believed that the <i>naal </i>is very
            good for a woman who is unable to conceive? That if she is given a bit of the <i>naal
            </i>after grinding it, she will be able to have a baby. Tell us what you know about
            this. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Teeja: The older women say that the Dai hides the <i>naal </i>
            and brings it and gives some of it to a barren woman and she is then able to conceive.
            But this is not a good thing. If the Dai gets caught bringing the <i>naal </i>away
            quietly she will get a very bad name. And it is not really true that she is able
            to conceive after eating a bit of <i>naal </i>. You need to get a check up from
            the doctor in order to conceive. If the man and woman don&#8217;t have child bearing
            eggs then how will it help to eat anyone&#8217;s <i>naal </i>. I don&#8217;t think
            it is good to give someone else&#8217;s <i>naal </i>. You get a bad name and it
            is also a <em>paap</em>.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Shanti: Just like you give the baby for <i>uparla </i>. You keep
            the residual <i>naal </i>by drying it and use it for <i>uparla </i>. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Teeja: The baby is innocent. It will eat whatever is given to
            it. It will even eat mud or cow-dung. If we give <i>naal </i>after making it into
            a paste it will eat it but the jacha will not eat it. And I don&#8217;t believe
            that by giving a paste of <i>naal </i>it will protect it from getting pneumonia.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Renuka: In our last workshop a lot of women told us that they
            dry some of the <i>naal </i>and keep it and make a paste of it when it is to be
            given. </span>
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Teeja: Well, if a paste of <i>naal </i>is given, your eyes don&#8217;t
            get sore so people do keep it. But it is not given to other women. It cannot be
            given because there are 36 <em>naadis</em> and giving it is tantamount to committing
            a <em>paap</em>. Careful <i>dais</i>, do not give it. </span>

    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Shanti: What all happens during the birthing process? From taking

            Tell us about it.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Paana: In one case, a baby was born at eight o&#8217;clock in
            the evening. She was in labour for two days before that. They came to me at 11o&#8217;clock
            at night. I was sleeping. When I went to her house, the woman was cold and sleeping.
            They had spread <i>mitti </i>under her. She had given birth to a girl and the baby
            was just lying there. I told them to separate the baby at least. I cut the <i>naala</i>
            and separated the baby girl and put <i>teeka</i> on her. I gave the woman warm milk
            and ghee to drink. Then I told them that the baby will be born around 12 or 1 o&#8217;clock.
            Then the woman started getting labour pains again. Then I held her <i>paet</i> (stomach)

            were much simpler and easier. Then the women used to keep hot sand underneath. They
            used to have <i>kaarha </i>of milk and ajwain. We used to give a lot of hot things
            and the babies would be born with absolute ease. Now it is very difficult. The women
            don&#8217;t eat properly. Their <i>japa </i>will certainly be affected by what they
            eat. Earlier they used to eat <em>bajre ki roti</em>, <em>moth</em>, <em>khichri</em>
            etc. These days you don&#8217;t see food like that. That kind of food was very good.
            Now they eat <em>kanak</em> (wheat). Now they eat milled rice. Earlier they used
            to get up at three in the morning and grind the <i>aata </i>and eat that. That&#8217;s

            banjaras</em> (nomads). Earlier, we used to keep travelling from place to place.
            We used to settle down every two kilometres or so. All my children were born this
            way. When my son was born, we had settled down near a sand dune. My daughter was
            making <em>rotis</em> (Indian bread). My water bag had been leaking for about five
            days. I was very hungry and I was eating. Suddenly, my labour pains began. It was
            the seventh month. My daughter started crying. My husband went to the village to
            call the <em>dai</em>. By the time the <em>Dai</em> arrived, the baby was already
            born. While the <em>Dai</em> was approaching the house, she heard the baby&#8217;s
            cry and knew immediately from the sound of the baby&#8217;s cry, that it was a boy.
            The baby cried a lot at birth. I cut the cord myself and bathed the baby. Soon after
            that I began to feel very cold. My family members covered me with lots of sheets
            but I still kept shivering. I kept going towards the <i>chullah </i>(cooking stove).
            My husband kept asking if I am going to die. I said that I was going to die for
            sure. When the baby was being born, the sand was hot so I didn&#8217;t feel it.
            As soon as the pains had started, my daughter had heated the sand. We usually bring
            sand and keep in a mud pot. In the hot sand, I had not felt cold. But after the
            <i>anwal naal </i>was cut and I had bathed, I started shivering with cold. I just
            was not able to feel better. Then my husband gave me some opium to eat. I took that.
            That really had effect on me and I went to sleep and awoke only the next morning.
            My son was born in the seventh month but I didn&#8217;t wrap him in anything in
            particular. He survived on his own. He is tall and fair and is now twenty years

            The <em>Jacha</em> does not see the sun before this day. And until this day her
            body is considered unclean. Now, the <em>Jacha</em> herself does <em>puja</em> and
            thanks God that she has given birth to a new life. We pray to the Suraj whether
            it is a girl or a boy. We tie a <em>tani</em> in the name of the baby. Meanwhile,
            we also make <em>roti</em> with <em>kacha</em> <i>aata </i>. On the day of the <em>Suraj
                puja</em>, the <em>Brahmin</em> (priestly caste) makes the <em>chanwari</em>.
            He does the <em>puja</em>. We also give him <em>dakshina</em> (offerings). If the

            name and conduct the <em>puja</em> ourselves with ghee made from cow&#8217;s milk.
            We clean the aangan (courtyard) and decorate it for the puja. The dai does the puja.
            She is given a lot of importance on this day. She bathes and wears new clothes.
            She is the first one to be fed. She is given special food so that she is content.
            This ensures that the <em>Jacha</em> and baby are also content. Then the <em>dai</em>
            will not cast an evil eye on them. But some people don&#8217;t call the <em>dai</em>
            because the more days she works for them, the more money they will have to pay.
            They only call her up to the <em>Jalwa</em> puja day. On this day, they give her
            five rupees. This is called <em>kansa</em> <em>dena</em>. Some <i>dais</i> don&#8217;t

            After that we do <em>kuan</em> <em>puja</em>. The baby&#8217;s <em>Bua</em> makes
            <em>sathiya</em> outside the door of the room where birth has taken place. <em>Sathiya</em>
            is made with cow dung. This cow dung has to be fresh of that particular morning.
            On this <em>sathiya</em> <em>roli</em>, <em>mehndi</em>, <em>sindoor</em>,etc is
            made into a <em>tikki</em>. The <em>Bua</em> has to be a married woman. She has
            to make the <em>sathiya</em> and wear a nose ring and yellow clothes. The <em>Jacha</em>
            has to give naek to the Nanad. It can be in the form of a <em>sari</em> or a <em>ring</em>.
            On the <em>Jalwa</em> <em>puja</em> day, we tie neem leaves on the doors of the
            house. The <em>sathiya</em> <em>puja</em> is done around ten or eleven in the morning.
            After the <em>puja</em>, the whole family eats. Even the <em>Jacha</em> is bathed
            and given new clothes to wear. Her folks from her <em>peehar</em> also bring new
            clothes. After this occasion of <em>kuan</em> <em>puja</em>, the <em>Jacha</em>
            is considered clean enough to do the household chores. Her body is considered to
            have recovered sufficiently. This <em>kuan</em> <em>puja</em> is done on the 25th,
            30th, 40th day. Until this day the <em>Jacha</em> is not considered fit enough to
            do any of the chores in the house. After the sathiya puja in the morning, at around
            four or five in the evening, shortly before sunset, the <em>kuan</em> <em>puja</em>
            is done. The <em>Jacha</em> wears new bangles of different colours. They are usually
            made of lac and are red and green in colour. The <em>ghadas</em> (water vessels)
            of the house are changed. The old vessels are removed. The other family people around
            also change their old water vessels and buy new ones. This is because they believe
            that there is<em> sua/sutak</em> in all the houses. For instance, if there are three
            brothers in a family and they all live separately, and one brother has a baby in
            his house. Then all the brothers will get new water vessels in their homes. On this
            day all the family members get together. Seven friends meet together. They celebrate
            <em>ghughri</em> with a lot of festivities and then do puja. If the family can afford
            to do so, they feed all the relatives. They sing songs. After this puja, the <em>Jacha</em>
            is fit enough to join in the chores of the house.</span></p>

        <span class="default">Madhu: The sessions on <em>reeti-rewaz </em>were very good. We
            learnt a lot of things from all of you. But a few things were not very clear to
            us. For instance, can only the pundit do the<em> Chanwri puja</em> or can the dai
            also do it? </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Jamuna and a few other <i>dais</i>: In the homes where a pundit
            will not enter, it is the <em>dai</em> who conducts the puja. The pundit believes
            in <em>chua-choot </em>and will not come into our homes so then we do the <em>puja</em>
            ourselves. We just ask the <em>pundit</em> for the alphabet with which the name
            should begin and then we do the puja. </span>

    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Madhu: In this session, we would like to talk a little more about
            <em>pahar</em>. In the previous workshop you had talked about time and the particular
            times when the baby usually arrives. You seem to have a special understanding of
            when the baby is likely to be born and when it is not likely to arrive. You also
            have an understanding of what is a good time for birth and what is not a good time.
            <i>japa </i>seems to be connected with this <em>pahar</em>. Then there is the old
            system of conducting the birth of the baby on <i>mitti </i>that is spread and now
            there is this new system of spreading a plastic sheet. So, we would like you to
            enact these two different ways of <i>japas</i> through a role play and discuss them.

            Then we heat it. The sand that we need to use at this time has to be absolutely
            clean, white and fine. This kind of sand, we bring earlier and keep in the house.
            We fill the ghadas and keep. In the room where the <i>japa </i>will be conducted,
            we spread the heated sand where the portion below the Jacha&#8217;s waist will be

            At this time the whole <i>shareer </i>is open and the sand goes in. This can cause
            a lot of harm. Though we do strain and heat the sand and there should be no germs

            the baby will arrive at 11 a.m.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">The time of twelve o&#8217;clock is considered <em>sunn</em> (very
            still and quiet) time. Babies are not usually born at this hour. One woman had started
            her pains. I said her baby would be born at four in the evening. After this the
            next hour for births is nine in the evening. Babies are not born in between these
            hours.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Sayar: When it is time for the cows to go grazing, we believe
            that the babies are not born during this period. They are usually born when the
            cows return home around four in the evening. </span>

    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Rukma: Some people count four hours in each pahar. Some count
            only three hours in each <em>pahar</em>. But I count four hours for each pahar.

    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Rukma: Even the pains are assessed according to pahars. Like,
            we say it will be another pahar before the baby will be born. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Madhu: Do you have any experience where you feel your assessment
            has been quite accurate?</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Rukma: It has always happened this way with me. I just went for
            one <i>japa </i>. The pains had started in the morning. I said it would take at
            least two more <em>pahars</em>. Sure enough, the baby was born at four in the evening.

    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Madhu: In the last workshop, you had told us that you use the
            size of a rupee coin to assess the readiness of the bachadani ka munh - that the
            opening of it should be the size of a rupee coin and based on this you are able
            to tell which <em>pahar</em> the baby will be born. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Sayar: Yes, we do say that if the opening of the uterus has become
            the size of a rupee coin, it is time for the baby to arrive. If it is opened only
            as much as an eight anna coin, we say it will take one more pahar. </span>

            (hut). I have even done it on the floor. As soon as the child is born, I take it
            into my hands. When the <i>anwal </i>gets fully expelled, only then I<em> naal modte
                hain</em> (knot, twist the cord). We bury it outside the house. The Jacha is
            not able to push properly if she lies in a <em>macha</em> (cot). She is not in a
            comfortable position in a macha. The birth is conducted on the floor and after the
            <i>anwal </i>is expelled, we shift her into the cot. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Sayar: If the woman wants to deliver her baby in a sitting position,
            we let her, otherwise we make them lie down and deliver the baby. Earlier, we used
            to spread sand for the woman to lie in, but now we use a plastic sheet. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Rukma: Some women deliver very easily. Some others have problems

            to get clean sand from the <em>dhore</em> (sand dunes) heat it and spread it. But
            we found that sand causes a lot of itching. Now the women refuse to lie on the sand
            and they prefer to spread the plastic sheet. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Mohini: Now the women say that their lives have improved. In the

            spread it. The woman was not allowed to bathe before. She didn&#8217;t wear clothes
            before <em>Chhati</em> in the earlier days nor did the baby. But now they both wear
            clothes and they don&#8217;t want to lie in the sand.</span></p>

        </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Saraswati: My children were all born on the sand in the courtyard
            of the house. They used to keep a lit <em>angeethi</em> (coal stove) towards the
            feet and it used to keep us warm and comfortable. It did cause a lot of scratching
            and sometimes the body used to get sore with the constant scratching. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Sayar: When we had just started using plastic sheets, the women
            didn&#8217;t like it because they could see a lot of blood on it. They used to get
            scared looking at so much blood. They also found it rather cold during the winter.
            In the summer, it was found to be uncomfortably hot too. But now they find it quite
            comfortable and they don&#8217;t have problems of scratching any more. </span>

    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Kheevni: Earlier, they also didn&#8217;t like the idea of using
            something that has already been used for someone else. But now they don&#8217;t
            feel that way. In fact, now the people use the plastic sacks used for fertilisers
            and open it and convert into plastic sheets for themselves. We spread a cloth on
            the plastic sheet and so the blood doesn&#8217;t collect but gets soaked by the
            cloth. They all feel that their lives have improved a lot and they don&#8217;t have
            to suffer the terrible itching anymore. </span>

    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Badu: As the plastic sheets were introduced very suddenly, the
            women didn&#8217;t like it. But now that we have tried to explain the advantages
            of using the plastic sheets and we also spread another cloth over it, the women
            don&#8217;t object any more. </span>

        the Saas to boil some dry coconut in milk and give to the pregnant woman. She then
        makes a karha with lawang and makes the pregnant woman drink it. This increases
        the labour pains and the Jacha groans away in pain.

        The Saas asks for the pots where sand has been stored.</p>

        mother. Then she removes the plastic sheet and goes to throw the gandagi (bad blood).
        Thereafter, she washes the plastic sheet and cloth. Then she makes a pad with cloth

        <span class="default">Kheevni: We used to get the sand from the dunes during the rains.
            We used to heat the sand from before and make a pad with it. Then we would keep
            it under the woman&#8217;s anus. If people suffered from backache, we brought the
            sand from the base of the arandi tree. Now people believe in modern medicine. People

            takes place when the <em>Jacha</em> is weak. Seeing this heavy bleeding, I got anxious.
            Then I sent for the doctor. He gave an injection that stopped the bleeding. He also
            gave a glucose drip that gives energy to the woman. When there is swelling and there
            are problems, I take the <em>Jacha</em> to the doctor. He examines the <em>Jacha</em>
            and checks if she has a shortage of water or blood. When there were no doctors we
            just gave some medicines. </span>

            gave her a lot of sugar cane juice. I gave her gur ka pura in desi ghee. The jaundice

            my bag of waters burst. I came into the room and found there was no one in the house.
            I held my head and sat down on the floor and the baby came out. Even the <i>anwal </i>
            came out. I cut the <i>anwal naal</i>myself. My little daughter brought me warm

            pregnant woman comes to this house, we make her put her feet over the ground where
            the <i>anwal </i>has been buried. We believe that by doing this, the baby will be
            protected for nine months in the mother&#8217;s womb and the birth will be easy.

            the size of a channa (a particular lentil). You can make this out quite easily.

    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Teeja: I can tell quite confidently if the woman is pregnant by
            just touching her. Actually, her face also indicates if she is pregnant. Her face
            is usually a little pale, her breasts are bigger, and her body itself shows her

        <span class="default">Saraswati: Of course the woman has her own <em>shakti</em>. In
            the earlier days, she used to deliver her babies while working in the fields. She
            could deliver her baby and cut the cord herself with the sickle she had with her.
            Then she could walk home with the baby. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Revati: A lot of women have their babies alone in their own homes.
            Sometimes, the <i>dais</i> are not able to reach there in time and the babies are
            already born. Sometimes, even the women from the neighbouring homes are not around,
            especially if the baby arrives at night. The woman has her baby on her own then.
            The presence of the dai gives her a lot of support and courage for sure. But the
            strength is within the <em>Jacha</em> herself. The dai and the neighbourhood women
            are able to help with food etc. which gives the <em>Jacha</em> a lot of support.
            We give her courage and affection. We massage her hands and legs gently. Our <em>shakti</em>
            is the patient support and courage we give her. It is her own <em>shakti</em> which
            helps the Jacha go through the birth of her child.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Teeja: A weak woman sweats and loses a lot of her <em>taakat</em>
            (energy). If she becomes too hot, we give her cow&#8217;s milk and <em>ghee</em>,
            which makes her cool again. We feel the woman and check if she is hot. If she is,
            then we don&#8217;t give her <em>ajwain</em>, <em>lawang</em> etc. as this will
            enhance the heat in her body. We give her only milk and ghee as this will give her
            the energy she needs and also give a little lubrication within but keep her from
            getting any further heat as she is already quite hot. </span>

    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Revati: We don&#8217;t give <em>lawang</em> very often because
            that produces a lot of heat. Now we give iron for nine months. The earlier women
            used to eat gur and that automatically gave them the iron they needed. Now instead
            of eating gur, they eat iron tablets. If they keep eating gur throughout their pregnancy,
            it will be very good for them. If, during the pains, we boil gur in milk and give
            to the <em>Jacha</em>, the baby will be born immediately. The dai holds the legs
            and gives her energy to the <em>Jacha</em>. In the earlier days, the women used
            to use their own strength, so the dai didn&#8217;t need to give her energy. Now
            a days, the women leave their bodies very loose and limp. They don&#8217;t have
            much strength and are much weaker too. Though the women are far more comfortable
            as compared to the women of the earlier days, they don&#8217;t have much strength.
            This is because their food is not so good now. </span>

    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Jamuna: We give ajwain ka karha. If the baby is born in its caul,
            we tear the caul and remove the baby. We examine the Jacha. If she is cool, then
            water will come out. But if she is hot, there will be blood. If there is bleeding
            before the birth of the baby, we immediately take her to a doctor.
            <br />
            Kheevni: The temperature of the body should be even and moderate. If it fluctuates
            a lot, there could be complications. Ajwain is given only if the body is cool. If
            there is heat in the body, we give sugar water, cool milk mixed with saunf and sugar
            so that her temperature stays moderate. </span>

        <span class="default">When the pains are mild, we don&#8217;t give anything. These are
            called false pains. If we give anything during this, it could create problems. Only
            when the bachadani ka munh is opened to the size of a rupee coin, do we give any
            hot foods. </span>

            We don&#8217;t examine anything internally. Only during birth do we put our hands

            If the baby is <em>aada</em>, we cannot make it <i>seedha</i>. The doctor has to
            help with such deliveries. The baby will remain in the position it is in. If it
            is slightly <em>terha</em>, we can make it <i>seedha</i> but an aada baby we cannot
            handle. We send them straight to the hospital. Also, if the mouth of the bachadani
            does not dilate adequately, we send the <em>Jacha</em> to the hospital. We don&#8217;t
            like to delay because it could prove fatal for the Jacha.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Sayar: In the case of one birth, the <em>pukka</em> <em>dard</em>
            had started and we discovered that the baby is aada. We took her to the hospital
            in a vehicle. We found that the baby&#8217;s fingers were caught in the intestines.
            That is why there was this complication. In another <i>japa</i>, the head was stuck
            and in the process of trying to get the baby out, the mother and baby, both died.

            without bothering to ask a doctor, to stop taking the medicines. I gave her <em>ajwain</em>.
            I am able to tell if a woman is pregnant in her second month, by looking at her
            face. Early in the morning we give ajwain, channa and other dry things to prevent
            nausea. The <em>dai</em> has to use her mind and body to assist in the birth of
            a baby. The woman, of course, has to use her entire strength. </span>

            actively involved in the planning and organising of it. Hence he was a very important
            person for the workshop. He had gone to Udaipur for three years on a temporary basis
            two months earlier. He had gone to work with another organisation. We felt the need
            for his presence through the planning of this second workshop. There was a definite
            lack of leadership among the Urmul workers. While the workshop was in progress,
            he turned up as a surprise to everyone. His unexpected return was the first point
            discussed briefly at this meeting. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Satyanarayanji: I had gone to work with this organisation which
            is dealing with mother and child health. This is Dr.Keerti Iyengar&#8217;s organisation.
            They are trying to train intermediary people between nurses and doctors who can
            operate technical equipment at different centres that they plan to open. They also
            have another plan where expectant fathers will be included in the health education
            programme. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">But this is a very backward area. They still talk of <em>dakan</em>
            etc. So this resulted in my decision to return here. The local people there consider
            women as <em>dakans</em>. They harass them. There was an incident where a man was
            beating his first wife after declaring to the people that she was a dakan. I intervened
            and registered an FIR at the police station. These were powerful people. They got
            after me and they started harassing me. Then I realised that the organisation would
            be affected adversely on my account. Hence, I decided to return here.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Madhu: We would like to begin the evaluation of the workshop now.
            You tell us how you found the sessions. We would also like to thank Ramratni who
            managed everything quite well. We didn&#8217;t feel the lack of anything. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">I just have a couple of points that I&#8217;d like to mention.
            There is a lack of communication through letters from your side. For instance, you
            advanced the dates for the previous workshop and you didn&#8217;t even send us any
            information. This upset our other programmes and commitments considerably. We found
            this quite inconvenient. We would really appreciate it if you kept in touch with
            us. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Satyanarayanji: This happened mainly because I left this place
            soon after the last workshop. Thereafter, Malliramji looked after things here. He
            didn&#8217;t understand the requirements here. This will not happen again. We will
            be in regular touch with you from now on. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Madhu: There were very few Urmul workers this time. We are not
            very happy with this as we needed their support for the workshop process. It caused
            a lot of problems in communicating with the <i>dais</i> as we are not familiar with
            the local language. Your workers were needed to help out in interpreting. You had
            seen in the previous workshop how much we depended on your workers to help us out
            in this area. We brought Shanti along this time even though she doesn&#8217;t work
            on a regular basis with our team. She works with Jagori but we requested her to
            come with us as she knows the Rajasthani language. If she hadn&#8217;t come, it
            would have been very difficult to carry on with the workshop. We had no idea that
            there will be so few of you participating this time. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Narsaram: This certainly has been a lapse on our part. We thought
            it is a training programme for the <i>dais</i>. That is why we didn&#8217;t arrange
            for more Urmul workers to be present. This will definitely not happen again. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Madhu: We had also asked for the <i>dais</i> to come a day earlier.
            Even that didn&#8217;t work out. So, that part of the day was not utilised. This
            aspect also needs to be taken care of. The rest of the programme was fine. The new
            <i>dais</i> who participated were experienced ones and we were able to get a lot
            of information from them. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Ramratni: The differences in opinion among the <i>dais</i> were
            mainly because some of the <i>dais</i> are old and experienced compared to some
            of the younger ones. Kheevni thinks she knows a lot and Sayar is sure she knows
            more than the others. That is why there were a few arguments. Kheevni has been with
            our organisation for almost ten years and feels that she has the right to speak
            with more authority. Sayar knows she has worked only for about two years but felt
            she knows a lot and should be allowed to express herself.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Renuka: But it is good that she wants to speak and has things
            to tell us.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Satyanarayanji: The older <i>dais</i> throw their weight around.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Renuka: Teeja was telling us that she works so hard and when the
            sanstha (organisation) people go for check-up visits, the people in the village
            complain. For instance, when they ask whether iron tablets were given, they will
            say that they don&#8217;t remember. If one of them has fought with us, they will
            say they were not given. Then, the sanstha people cut our money. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Satyanarayanji: No, that is not wholly true. For many reasons
            we had to introduce this system of checking. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Ramratni: Quite often, the <i>dais</i> do try to deceive the workers
            and sometimes the <i>dais</i> themselves tell us quite honestly what they have done
            and what they haven&#8217;t been able to do. For instance, Nanu Bai told us quite
            frankly that she hadn&#8217;t given iron tablets and that her money should be deducted.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Madhu: During our last visit, you had mentioned that you wanted
            to make a training module. What are your thoughts on that subject? Because we are
            considering the proposal quite seriously and would like to start working towards
            that if you need our assistance. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Satyanarayanji: First we need to see what we have already taught
            the <i>dais</i> and what we still need to teach them. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Madhu: You also need to see how relevant your old module is, because
            it seems to me that not all of it is relevant. For instance, your teaching them
            to cut the <i>naal </i>first is not really acceptable to them.<br />
            Satyanarayanji: We want to work out what an ideal <em>dai</em> should be like. What
            are the qualities and skills she needs to have. We need to work out who we can accept
            as the ideal dai as different organisations have different concepts of the ideal
            <em>dai</em>. What the village folk consider ideal and what we consider ideal could
            have many gaps.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Madhu: While giving the <i>dais</i> training, we also need to
            consider what the locally available resources are. So that she can easily put her
            training into practice. The <i>dais</i> are quite capable and confident. So, even
            while we give them training, we need to be very sensitive. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Satyanarayanji: I also feel that we keep pursuing them to come
            for training. There should also be an interest from their side to learn new things.
            There is no point in imposing any training on them if they don&#8217;t have a desire
            to learn.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Narsaram: We sometimes need to create an interest and desire in
            them. Like, they still want to spread sand. Now, we need to explain why sand should
            not be used. We have to arouse their interest in learning and understanding what
            we teach them. That is our responsibility.<br />
            We have worked out and decided on certain policies. You could also help us in some
            of that. We will give you a copy of that paper. You&#8217;ll get an idea of the
            goal we are working towards in order to help the <i>dais</i>. You can also give
            us your suggestions to help us achieve the goals we have set.<br />
            Satyanarayanji: You can help us with the goal we have set regarding the attempt
            to reduce maternal deaths. You can help with information on that problem so that
            the <i>dais</i> can be better informed in coping with those complications. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Madhu: This is a separate area of research. Like, what Ramratni
            was relating during the workshop, of the three maternal deaths, it was quite unnerving.
            The reasons for these deaths are not easy to determine. It is not a very simple
            matter. As Ramratni was telling us about a case, ten days after the baby&#8217;s
            birth, the mother got an <em>aithan</em> (knot, twist) inside her body and she died.
            You have come to the conclusion that it was tetanus. But we know that death from
            tetanus occurs within six days after the baby&#8217;s birth. So, such matters have
            to be researched very thoroughly and in great detail before any conclusions can
            be drawn regarding the probable cause of death. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Satynarayanji: If the woman has died on her own, then it is very
            difficult to make enquiries from the people in her home. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Renuka: That you will have to do. You will need to find out what
            symptoms were noticed, what her condition was, what sort of nourishment she was
            able to get, check for other possible illnesses. There could be so many different
            causes for her death. It is connected with her entire life. In Bihar, we did a case
            study on one maternal death. We made a very in-depth study to find out the possible
            causes. It is essential to make a detailed enquiry to determine the cause of such
            deaths.</span></p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Narsaram: We try to do that. Immediately after the death we have
            mentioned, we conducted a health camp. Eighty women participated in that camp. </span>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <span class="default">Satyanarayanji: The <i>dais</i> are not able to understand the
            cause of deaths. If the mother dies 3-4 days after the birth, the <i>dais</i> say
            that they had handled the birth 3-4 days earlier. They don&#8217;t realise that
            it takes that many days for an infection to spread. We are considering all these
            situations. In 1997, we took a census of all the pregnant women of our area. We
            are seriously keen on working towards achieving our goal. Let us hope you can also
            help us to fulfil our goal.<br />
        </span><span class="smltxt">They read out their policy paper and with this the meeting
            was concluded.</span><span class="default"><br />
