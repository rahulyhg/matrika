            King Dashrath is playing cards when somebody comes and tells him that his Rani is
            in pain and is anxious, she is calling for him. On hearing this Raja Dashrath throws
            his cards down and goes to see the Rani. </span></p>

            The Raja leaves his elephant and climbs on a horse and leaves for the country named
            Mangal looking for a dai. He sees a woman drawing water from a well.

        <p class="default2">
            Raja: Please tell me which one is the dagrin's (dai's) house?</p>
        <p class="default2">
            Woman: Her house is high up, the door is on the eastern side and in her courtyard
            is an arandi tree and that is the dagrin's house.</p>
        <p class="default2">
            The Raja calls out: Dagrin, dagrin</p>
        <p class="default2">
            The Dagrin does not say anything. The Raja thinks that this dagrin is a little snooty,
            she is not even replying.
            <br />
            <br />
            Dagrin: What is it Raja, is your mother unwell or is your sister unwell or is your
            chaachi (father's younger brother's wife) unwell?</p>
        <p class="default2">
            Raja: No dagrin, my mother is not going to have a baby nor is my sister expecting.
            It is my Rani who is going to have a baby and I have come to call you.</p>
        <p class="default2">
            The Dagrin agrees to go. The Raja quickly gets a palanquin and takes the dagrin
            to his country. The Dagrin takes one step and then the second step into the house
            and on her third step the babua (boy baby) is born.</p>
        <p class="default2">
            Dagrin: Give me gold bangles Raja then I will cut the naal. I will bathe the lalana
            (little boy) on a golden plate and prepare the bed for the baby to sleep in.</p>
