Many of us are increasingly aware that pregnancy, childbirth, and indeed the entire
dynamic of female bodily experience are becoming pathologized and commercialized.
Bodies, especially women's, are seen as places where disease and malfunction happen,
not pleasure, creativity and harmony.
<br />
<br />
We hope our MATRIKA website can help correct these misconceptions by showcasing
traditional Indian birth practices and practitioners who cooperate with nature rather
than ignoring or overriding it.<br />
<br />
We also hope you will contribute to the site by giving feedback, questions, critiques
and especially by sharing your own knowledge of other indigenous birth traditions.</b>
