        They also force us to give injections. These days everybody is in a hurry. Then
        we tell them very affectionately that we have delivered so many babies by giving
        hot drinks of <em>ghee</em> and milk.” (Tara, Delhi)<br />

    <img src="/assets/images/injection.jpg" width="300" height="223" class="floatLeft">What
    is called <em>sui-goli </em>(injections and tablets) medicine is rapidly replacing
    traditional practices in even the most remote parts of the country. The negative
    impact of pharmaceutical marketing and misuse in poor and rural areas cannot be
    overstated. We might speak, not only of the medicalisation of rural India, but its
    pharmaceuticalisation. The ‘irrational’ and harmful use of injections and tablets
    is a huge problem in both poor urban and rural areas. In many localities government
    medical facilities and practitioners do not exist. Chemist shops, however, do—and
    untrained people purchase and utilise pharmaceuticals. Families of laboring women
    increasingly tell the dai to ‘quickly deliver the baby’, pressuring them to resort
    to injections. Families want to use what they understand to be ‘modern’ methods
    of childbirth. Experienced dais resist this pressure, but also report that weak
    and malnourished women have little strength to push out the baby on their own.
