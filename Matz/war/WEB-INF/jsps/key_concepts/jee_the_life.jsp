    <span class="kcpt3">Krishna in a winnowing basket, shortly after his birth. Note the
        placenta, lying in the basket, still attached to the baby. Even today, in parts
        of Uttar Pradesh, the newborn is ritually placed in a winnowing basket honouring
        the analogy of the fertility of the female body with that of the earth.</span>
    <span class="kcpt4">“If the baby does not cry then I heat up the placenta and slap baby’s
        legs, blow in baby’s ears and slap the back of the baby.” - Jamna, Rajasthan<br />
        <br />
        “If the baby is not active or does not cry then the Dai rubs the cord, placing a
        coin or rice grain underneath it. By rubbing, heat passes to the baby. The baby
        often revives. We also resuscitate by rubbing the navel and heating the placenta
        on a fire.” (Bihar)<br />
        <br />
        “After birth, if the baby does not cry or is hardly breathing, or even seems stillborn,
        the placenta is used to revive it. I place the placenta on a heated surface, a pan
        or burning cow dung cakes. Jee flows towards the baby in most cases. It is only
        after this that the cord is cut.” (Delhi)<br />
    </span>

    The placenta is viewed as the baby’s life source and the site of jee. Dais use the
    word ‘jee’ to describe the palpable pulsations which they are able to track in the
    human body. During the third or fourth week after conception, skilled practitioners
    feel the splitting off of this life force energy to support the emerging life of
    the embryo, allowing them to detect a woman’s pregnancy. Biomedicine has no equivalent
    to the notion of jee. Chi or ki in Chinese and Japanese medicine; vital force in
    homeopathy; prana in Ayurveda, all signify life energy.

    Jee is energy and not simply matter. Even after the cord stops pulsating with blood,
    jee can pass to the baby from the placenta. As seen in the quotes above, life force
    is associated with, and stimulated by heat. Free flow of jee through the body maintains
    health. Obstructions or imbalances cause problems. Removing blockages in the nasae,
    channels for jee, is one of the functions of Indian forms of massage. Western massage
    therapies use strokes promoting venous return (up the arms and legs, towards the
    heart), but Indian massage techniques involve moving negative energies or blocks
    down the limbs and out of the body. Restoring balance of the panch mahabhuta (five
    elements), earth, air, fire, water and space, is also part of the therapeutic work
    of promoting jee.
