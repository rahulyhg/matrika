        &quot;<i>Bemata</i> is an old woman, has white hair and walks with the help of a
        stick. She stays under the earth and makes putle (puppets) and gives them to people.
        She gives to some people and does not give to others. When a baby smiles, it is
        believed that <i>Bemata</i> is making her smile.&quot; (Delhi)

    <span class="kcpt4">“There is the custom of cutting the atta or rice. When the labor
        pains have come and the dai has arrived, the jachcha puts both hands full of atta
        in the thali. The dai holds the wrist of the mother while she, with her hand, separates
        the atta into two parts from the middle. <i>Bemata</i> is worshipped by putting
        money and gur on top of the atta, offering it to the dai, and saying “In this way
        separate the mother and the child - so that the child is born without any difficulty.”
        It is said that when Ram and Lakshman were born <i>Bemata</i> herself came and acted
        as dai. Now it’s the dai, herself, who represents the shakti of <i>Bemata</i>. (Moti
        Dai, Delhi)<br />
        <br />
        “Look, sister, at the time of birth it’s only the woman’s Shakti. She who gives
        birth, at that time, her one foot is in heaven and the other, in hell. The woman’s
        Shakti is indeed a lot when she gives birth to a child. Before doing a delivery
        I.get the woman to open all the trunks, doors and so on. I pray to the One Above
        to open the knot quickly. I take off the sari, open the hair and take off the bangles
        or any jewellery. I put the atta on a thaali and ask the woman to divide it into
        two equal parts. Also I get Rs.1.25 in the name of Sayyid kept separately. But mostly
        I remember <i>Bemata</i>. Repeatedly I pray to the <i>Bemata</i> “Oh mother! please
        open the knot quickly.” (Shakina, Delhi)</span>

    <i>Bemata</i> is traditionally invoked at the time of childbirth, with some variation
    of names, throughout North India. <i>Bemata</i> is not like Durga or Saraswati,
    Lakshmi or even Santoshi Ma in that there are no temples, pilgrimage sites, texts,
    icons relating to her. She is a fleeting presence who only seems to represent female
    reproductive physiology. Manifesting as both a creative and a destructive force,
    she is procreativity while growing the baby, and pathology if she does not leave
    when her work is done. Imaged as a playful and rather fickle old woman, <i>Bemata</i>
    is amazingly familiar and at the same time tremendously powerful. She is invoked
    at the time of childbirth being the special patron of dais and parturient women.
    <i>Bemata</i> lives underground, creates human beings out of earth, breathes life
    into them and writes their fate on their foreheads shortly after birth. <i>Bemata</i>
    is immanent in all nature, grows and protects the baby in the womb, but is also
    responsible for complications if she does not ‘exit’ the mother’s body via postpartum
    bleeding. She is leaves the birth home at the time of the Chatti rite, six days
    after birth when she is thanked for growing and protecting the baby.

    <i>Bemata</i> encodes a process orientation towards birth and postpartum while providing
    a framework for diagnostics and therapeutics. In obstetrical practice an examination
    done first one minute and then five minutes after birth, called ‘the Apgar score’,
    is used to assess the well being of the newborn. It is a scale for measuring the
    infant’s process of adapting to extra-uterine life. But no such formal, process-oriented
    assessment is geared towards the bodily functioning of the mother postpartum, the
    time the dais call ‘the closing of the body’. <i>Bemata</i> operates as a diagnostic
    system assisting dais in their roles as caretakers of mothers, especially crucial
    in the six day post birth period.
