        Complications, Safety and Caesarian section rates</h1>
    <b>&#8220;There is no convincing and compelling evidence that hospitals give a better
        guarantee of safety for the majority of mothers and babies&#8230;The policy of encouraging
        all women to give birth in hospitals cannot be justified on grounds of safety.&#8221;

    People usually think of traditional practitioners and practices as unsafe&#8212;but
    we must remember that dais serve the poorest of the poor&#8212;women whose health
    status is already compromised when they conceive. Often they are overworked, malnourished,
    live in degraded environments, drink polluted water, are victims of gender violence
    and have no access to medical care. Are the dai or her practices responsible for
    maternal-child health problems within this environment? Or are the conditions of
    poverty responsible?<br /><br />

    Every midwife, anywhere in the world, wants medical backup for emergencies&#8212;dais
    and the women they serve want the same. Skilled doctors and well-equipped hospitals
    and nursing homes can be life-saving in an emergency. The problem, for the majority
    of poor women in India is that a doctor can do no more in a hut in a rural area
    with a birth crisis (and often less!) than can an expert dai. Doctors need an operating
    theatre (with electricity) and anaesthetist and pharmaceuticals, a blood bank, and
    all the paraphernalia of modern obstetrics to make a life-saving difference. As
    much as we might like to have these available for all birthing women, we currently
    do not. So a policy of institutionalized birth for all women is counter-productive.<br />

    <h2>
        Safe Motherhood&#8212;Bureaucracies and Babies</h2>
    An increasingly influential lobby is the Safe Motherhood movement&#8212;they follow
    the global refrain of the World Health Organization and Unicef &#8220;Skilled Attendance
    at Birth.&#8221; This skilled attendant is defined as a practitioner able to use
    pharmaceuticals during a birth emergency. However they do not consider dais as skilled
    nor are the majority of them considered able to become skilled. Why? Because they
    are not literate or able to use pharmaceuticals. The problem is one of human resources&#8212;how
    to utilize local, indigenous personnel for the majority of births and commit to
    provide facilities (well staffed hospitals and transport) for emergency situations.
    <br />
    <br />
    According to a prominent obstetrician representing the Federation of Obstetricians
    and Gynecologists at a Safe Motherhood meeting
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>&#8220;There are 1700 obstetrical and gynecological positions lying vacant in
        government clinics in India. Part of the reason is that most obstetricians are women,
        and women don&#8217;t go out to rural areas and staff Primary Health Centres and
        First Referral Units.&#8221;</strong>

    Most research shows that poor and traditionally oriented women want to give birth
    at home. The task of appreciating the skills of indigenous practitioners and practices
    in the area of obstetrics has not been attempted&#8212;in part because the bio-medical
    orientation of caregivers and policymakers. It is questionable how the <strong>right
        to Safe Motherhood</strong> might be realized when there is no right to work,
    right to food, or the right to use indigenous practitioners along with modern medical
    facilities? Safe motherhood advocates graphically showcase the suffering and deaths
    of poor women during childbearing. But women don&#8217;t suffer and die simply because
    they are pregnant, but because they are impoverished, malnourished and overworked.<br />

    <h2>
        The Caesarean Epidemic</h2>
    <i>(much of the data quoted below is dated. In part this is dure to the fact that the
        medical establishment dominates research in public health and hesitates to document
        and advertize its own failings)</i>
    <br />
    <br />
    On the other hand middle and upper class women face the over- medicalization of
    birth. One Indian study maintained that current high caesarean rates were part of
    a rising trend. In the states of Kerala and Goa, as well as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar,
    Gujarat, Karnataka, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh the risk of undergoing a caesarean
    section in private sector institutions is four or more times that in the public
    sector. <strong>(US Mishra and Mala Ramanathan &#8220;Delivery-related complications
        and determinants of caesarean section rates in India&#8221; Health Policy and Planning;
        17 (1) 90-98) </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    According to one World Health Organization document &#8220;Countries with some of
    the lowest perinatal mortality rates in the world have caesarean rates under 10%.
    Clearly there is no justification in any specific region to have more than 10-15%
    caesarean section births.&quot;
    <br />
    <br />
    &quot;Between 1970 and 1988, the American caesarean section rate rose from 5% of
    all births to nearly 25%. Few experts believe, and none have sound data, that American
    mothers or infants are on the whole better off because of this change. The occasional
    reports of complications, from delayed cesarean section, such as uterine rupture
    or fetal distress, make more headlines than the much more common, but harder-to-assess
    complications-pain, anesthesia risks, post-operative infections, and blood loss,
    for example-from hundreds of thousands of cesarean sections that simply did not
    need to be done.&quot; <a href="http://www.nchc.org/Berwick.html" target="_blank">(National
        Coalition on Health Care Report .D. B. Berwick)</a>
    <br />
    <br />
    In Sweden the caesarean section rate declined from 12% in 1983, the highest it had
    ever reached there, to 10.8% in 1990. <strong>At the same time perinatal mortality rates
        were reduced by half</strong>. Nordic countries are the only ones that have
    succeeded in keeping their caesarean rates from rising and where the rates did not
    exceed 14% through the 1990s. (<strong>Sheila Kitzinger, The Politics of Birth</strong>)

    &quot;The lack of concern among many obstetricians about the after-effects of the
    rising caesarean rates may result from the fact that they spend little time post-natally
    with women who had had caesarean sections and are far removed from any physical
    or psychological ill-effects resulting from the operation.&quot; (<strong>Francome,
        C.,Savage, W., Churchill, H. and Lewison, H. 1993. Caesarean Birth in Britain. London:

    <br />
    Continued increases in rates of obstetrical intervention are unlikely to lead to
    improvements in birth outcome and may result in a higher incidence of adverse outcome
    for mothers and their offspring. The risks associated with caesarean section include:
    damage to uterine blood vessels; accidental extension of the uterine incision; damage
    to the urinary bladder; anaesthesia accidents; wound infections; maternal mortality.
    Depressed Apgar score; higher rates of neonatal respiratory distress; shortened
    mean length gestation; and higher perinatal mortality in subsequent pregnancies.&quot;

        Interventions</strong>)
    <br />
    <br />
    J. Quilligan, MD, an editor of the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology
    wrote, &quot;Every hospital that has an obstetric service should have some committee
    that examines every cesarean section that is performed in that hospital and determines
    whether it was indicated or not. If it was not indicated, then the physician who
    performed the section should be educated as to why it was not indicated.&quot; (<strong>B.L.

        Utilization. New York: Springer-Verlag.</strong>)
    <br />
    <br />
    Luella Klein, MD, Past President of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
    (ACOG) said, &quot;Reducing cesarean section rates is not easy. It will require
    a major change in attitudes for patients, for obstetricians, for nurses, for hospitals,
    and for families... We need to close the gap between what we know to be an appropriate
    cesarean rate and what is actually done in practice. We could get a health bargain
    for women and a financial bargain for our health care system.&quot; (Flamm, B. L.,
