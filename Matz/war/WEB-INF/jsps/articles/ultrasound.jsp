        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ultrasound: high-frequency sound
            waves that travel at 10 to 20 million cycles per second. The pattern of echo waves
            creates a picture of tissue and bone. </font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1987, UK radiologist H.D. Meire,
            who had been performing pregnancy scans for 20 years, commented, &quot;The casual
            observer might be forgiven for wondering why the medical profession is now involved
            in the wholesale examination of pregnant patients with machines emanating vastly
            different powers of energy which is not proven to be harmless to obtain information
            which is not proven to be of any clinical value by operators who are not certified
            as competent to perform the operations&quot; (1). </font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Routine prenatal ultrasound (RPU)
            actually detects only between 17 and 85 percent of the 1 in 50 babies who have major
            abnormalities at birth (2,3). </font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">RPU can identify a low-lying placenta
            (placenta previa). However, 19 of 20 women who have placenta previa detected on
            an early scan will be needlessly worried: the placenta will effectively move up
            without causing problems at the birth. Furthermore, detection of placenta previa
            by RPU has not been found to be safer than detection in labor (4).</font></p>
    <p>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The American College of Obstetricians
            has concluded that &quot;in a population of women with low-risk pregnancies, neither
            a reduction in perinatal morbidity and mortality nor a lower rate of unnecessary
            interventions can be expected from routine diagnostic ultrasound. Thus ultrasound
            should be performed for specific indications in low-risk pregnancy (5). </font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Effects of ultrasound include cavitation,
            a process wherein the small pockets of gas that exist within mammalian tissue vibrate
            and then collapse. In this situation &quot;...temperatures of many thousands of
            degrees Celsius in the gas create a wide range of chemical products, some of which
            are potentially toxic. These violent processes may be produced by microsecond pulses
            of the kind which are used in medical diagnosis.&quot; (American Institute of Ultrasound
            Medicine Bioeffects Report 1988). The significance of cavitation in human tissue
            is unknown. </font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Studies have suggested that these
            effects are of real concern in living tissues: *Cell abnormalities caused by exposure
            to ultrasound were seen to persist for several generations (6). *In newborn rats
            (similar stage of development as human fetuses at four to five months in utero),
            ultrasound can damage the myelin that covers nerves (7). *Exposing mice to dosages
            typical of obstetric ultrasound cased a 22% reduction in the rate of cell division
            and doubling of the rate of aptosis (programmed cell death), in the cells of the
            small intestine (8). *Two long-term randomized controlled trials comparing exposed
            and unexposed childrens' development at eight to nine years old found no measurable
            effect from ultrasound. However, the authors comment that intensities used today
            are many times higher than there were in 1979 and 1981 (9).</font></p>

    <p>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A retrospective study to explore
            the associations of placenta previa with preterm delivery, growth restriction, and
            neonatal survival examined birth/infant death records from 22,368,235 singleton
            pregnancies. Previa-related births were by cesarean. Analyses were adjusted for
            year of delivery, maternal age, gravidity, education, prenatal care, marital status,
            and race/ethnicity. Placenta previa was recorded in 2.8 per 1000 live births. Neonatal
            mortality rate was 10.7 with previa compared with 2.5 per 1,000 among other pregnancies,
            but among preterm births, placenta previa was not associated with increased neonatal
            mortality. Babies born to women with placenta previa weighed less than babies born
            to women without placenta previa; compared with babies born to women without previa,
            the risk of death from placenta previa was lower among preterm babies of less than
            37 weeks gestation. At 37 weeks the mortality rate was higher for babies born to
            women with placenta previa than for babies born to women without placenta previa.</font></p>
