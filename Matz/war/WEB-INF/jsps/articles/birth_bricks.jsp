PHILADELPHIA, PA Summer 2002&#8212;University of Pennsylvania Museum archaeologists
have discovered a 3700-year-old &quot;magical&quot; birth brick inside the palatial
residence of a Middle Kingdom mayor&#8217;s house just outside Abydos, in southern
Egypt. The colorfully decorated mud birth brick&#8212;the first ever found&#8212;is
one of a pair that would have been used to support a woman&#8217;s feet while squatting
during actual childbirth.

The birth brick, which measures 14 by 7 inches, was discovered during summer 2001
excavations directed by Dr. Josef Wegner, Associate Curator, Egyptian section of
the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. The ancient
brick still preserves colorful painted scenes and figures: clearly visible is a
mother holding her newborn baby, as well as magical images of gods whose role was
to protect and aid the mother and baby at the time of birth.

According to Dr. Wegner, Egyptologists have long known, from ancient texts, that
the standard form of childbirth in ancient Egypt was for the woman to deliver the
baby while squatting on two mud bricks. The upper surface of the birth brick discovered
at Abydos, unlike the bottom and sides, is crumbled away. &quot;It is quite possible,&quot;
Dr Wegner notes, &quot;that the damage to the top of the brick &#8212;and another
like it that has not been preserved&#8212; was caused by its use to support a woman's
feet in childbirth for a long period of time and during multiple deliveries.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<em><strong>And whose birth brick was this?</strong></em> Dr. Wegner and the Penn
excavation team have a pretty good idea of who may have used the birth brick: a
noblewoman and princess named Renseneb. Back in the summer of 1999, the Penn team
discovered (from seal impressions with hieroglyphic texts and other objects) that
the grandiose building they were excavating was, in fact, the mayor&#8217;s residence&#8212;the
first ancient Egyptian mayor&#8217;s residence ever positively identified. The birth
brick recently unearthed was in an area clearly identified as a female residential
section of the house. Numerous inscribed clay seal impressions found in this area
have the name of the &quot;noblewoman and king's daughter Renseneb.&quot; Dr. Wegner
suspects that this woman, who lived during Egypt's 13th Dynasty, may have been a
princess who was married to one of the town's mayors.

The Egyptians likened the birth of a child to the rising of the sun at daybreak.
The magical practices of childbirth were intended to protect a newborn baby in a
way paralleling Egyptian myths where the young sun god required protection from
hostile forces. On the birth brick from the Abydos excavation the sun god appears
in symbolic form in the guise of a desert cat. Images of the guardians of the sun
god decorate the sides of the brick, to magically provide similar protection for
mother and child, according to Dr. Wegner.

<br />
One set of objects closely associated with the recently discovered birth brick are
magical wands usually decorated with scenes of deities and demons--and the Penn
excavators have discovered fragments of these as well in the mayor's residence.
Egyptologists know that such wands were used in a form of &quot;sympathetic magic&quot;
that invoked divine forces to protect the newborn baby at the time of birth in the
same way, according to Egyptian myth, that the allies of the sun god would protect
him when he was young and vulnerable.

<strong>Pushpa</strong>: &#8220;It is easier to deliver by squatting on bricks.
It is easy to push this way. There is always another woman to give support. When
the pains start, she sits and holds the birthing woman.&#8221;(Delhi)<br />
<br />
<strong>Munni</strong>: &#8220;I also had my baby on bricks. You can put pressure
more easily. It&#8217;s not as easy while lying on a cot. The <em>jacha</em> is
made to squat on the bricks only when the baby&#8217;s head starts showing. With
the third pain, the baby comes out.&#8221;(Delhi)
