	<h1>The Role of Traditional Birth Attendants in The National Rural
	Health Mission</h1>
	<h3>National Consultation</h3>
	<div class="copyright">May 1 and 2, 2008 - New Delhi</div>
	<br />
	<h3>Context</h3>
	The objectives of the consultation were to share experience and evidence
	on the role and functions performed by Dais ( Traditional Birth
	Attendants) in different parts of the country in the current context of
	NRHM and promotion of institutional delivery through the Janani Suraksha
	Yojana. From experiences shared from across the country it emerged that<br />
	<ul>
		<li>Dais (Traditional Birth Attendants) continued to play an
		important role both in home and in institutional deliveries in
		different parts of the country</li>
		<li>Where institutional deliveries were on the rise, the Dai were
		involved in providing timely referral, accompanying mothers to the
		hospital and staying with her, and providing post-natal care and
		advice.</li>
		<li>Communities tended to prefer Dais over ASHAs in many places
		for taking mothers to institutions</li>
		<li>New training curriculum had been developed where Dais were
		trained to perform various social mobilizing roles related to maternal
		and neonatal health care</li>
		<li>Conflict was emerging between ASHA and the Dai due to the
		financial incentive provided through Janani Suraksha Yojana.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	The consultation was attended by Dais, civil society organizations and
	public health specialists from 11 states and was also attended by
	representatives from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,
	Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government
	of Gujarat, GTZ, WHO ( SEARO), DFID, USAID, UNFPA among others.<br />
	<br />
	<h3>Key Recommendations</h3>
	All participants agreed it was necessary to include Dais within the
	ambit of NRHM without losing focus on the need to promote and
	universalize safe deliveries conducted by skilled birth attendants with
	appropriate back up for Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Services.<br />
	<br />
	<h3>Roles and Responsibilities : Childbirth and beyond</h3>
	The role of the Dai (Traditional Birth Attendant ) should not only be
	seen in the context of conducting childbirth. Her role in maternal
	health should be seen in the context of continuum of care and support of
	maternal and new born health: both at homes and in institutions. In the
	context of institutions she should be seen as a birth companion,
	providing psychosocial and emotional support even in institutional
	deliveries. She should be seen as a part of a team of providers along
	with the SBA.<br />
	<br />
	Daiâ€™s ( Traditional Birth Attendants) can fulfill a large range of
	functions based on the context. This can include mobilization of drop
	outs and hard to reach groups for Family Planning, immunisation, child
	health, nutrition, health insurance, disease control programmes and so
	on. She can be entrusted with the responsibility of social mobilization,
	especially to reach the socially excluded.<br />
	<br />
	Dais ( Traditional Birth Attendants) should be included as an official
	member of primary health care team at the village level. This team
	should comprise of the Dai/ASHA/ANM/AWW & VHSC. Dais should be
	represented in monthly review meetings at the PHC and block levels.<br />
	<br />
	Where there is an opportunity Dais ( Traditional Birth Attendants)
	should be given preference for selection as ASHAs. Literacy related
	criteria should be waived for Dais.<br />
	<br />
	<h3>Decentralised Planning</h3>
	Dais ( Traditional Birth Attendants) should be consulted in the process
	of decentralized village level, block level and district level planning.
	A role for Dais (Traditional Birth Attendants) as birth companions and
	social mobilisers must be included in the decentralized plans. <br />
	<br />
	Areas where institutions are not prepared and do not have adequately
	trained staff or equipment, and in all tribal villages and hamlets, and
	in Scheduled Caste habitations, ( Traditional Birth Attendants) Dais
	must be trained as safe delivery providers, with a very strong referral
	and transport back up system.<br />
	<br />
	Programme guidelines for NGO programmes should enable Dais ( Traditional
	Birth Attendants) to be engaged in programmes for unserved/ underserved
	areas<br />
	<br />
	<h3>Capacity Building</h3>
	State and region specific Dai ( Traditional Birth Attendants)
	reorientation and training curricula must be drawn up. These curricula
	should build upon the existing beneficial practices of Dais and should
	build up a specified set of knowledge and skill sets that appropriate
	for the area and lines with the roles of Dais that has been mentioned
	above.<br />
	<br />
	<ul>
		<li>Based on capacity needs assessment</li>
		<li>Documentation and inclusion of beneficial traditional
		practices</li>
		<li>Psychosocial aspects should be reinforced</li>
		<li>Include on the job mentoring</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	Training must focus on achieving a minimum quality of care (set
	standards)<br />
	<br />
	Functional literacy should be included in the training of Dais<br />
	<br />
	Dai schools must be set up at the local level. Training must be done
	within the community as this enables communities support and recognition
	<br />
	<br />
	Doctors and nurses must be oriented to the content and methodology of
	TBA training. They must be sensitive to the importance of dais TBAs as
	service providers<br />
	<br />
	Dais should be included in ASHA/AWW orientation/refresher training/field
	mentoring<br />
	<br />
	<h3>Empowerment of Dais</h3>
	The role of Dais ( Traditional Birth Attendants) needs to be formally
	recognized within the NRHM. This could include establishing
	accreditation and certification mechanisms which follow the training
	programme mentioned above. <br />
	<br />
	Dais who have been accredited and certified should receive an identity
	card. Referrals coming from Dais with identity cards need priority
	attention for ambulance calls and in FRUs<br />
	<br />
	Dai collectives should promoted at the Panchayat, block, district, State
	& National level. These collectives should contribute to the training
	and accreditation process as well as provide a platform for sharing of
	experiences.<br />
	<br />
	<h3>Financial incentives and allocations for Dais</h3>
	Dais should be included with the financial incentive envelopes developed
	with NRHM. Where the mother is entitled to a financial support of Rs.
	500 for home deliveries, some financial compensation needs to be
	provided to the Dais as well. Dais should get the incentive included in
	the JSY programme when she accompanies the mother to the institution. <br />
	<br />
	Separate financial allocation must be made for capacity building
	(including needs assessment documentation of existing practices);
	accreditation and certification mechanisms, providing financial
	incentives for providing services and for organizing into groups. <br />
