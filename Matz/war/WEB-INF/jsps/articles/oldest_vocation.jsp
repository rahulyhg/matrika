            According to a very old story, a woman pope rules the Church of Rome 
            for a few years in the middle of the ninth century. Her name was Joan, 
            and as a young woman she lived in England where she fell in love with 
            a traveling student who was a monk. [Before there were universities, 
            most students were monks, and the intellectually curious among them 
            moved from library to library and from teacher to teacher, in search 
            of books and instruction.] Monks were not allowed to marry, but Joan 
            was brave as well as beautiful and brilliant, and she joined her lover 
            in his studies and travels, wearing male clerical clothing for safety 
            and concealment. The two wandered through Europe, acquiring vast learning, 
            until the man died and Joan was left alone. She continued to study 
            and to dress like a monk: Boccaccio, who told the story in the fourteenth 
            century, said that she refused &#8220;to attach herself to anyone 
            else or acknowledge that she was a woman.&#8221; Eventually she found 
            her way to Rome, where her outstanding virtue and learning were regarded 
            with election to the papal throne.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Joan 
            reigned as pope for a time, with nobody the wiser. Boccacio remarked: 
            &#8220;This woman was not afraid to mount the Fisherman&#8217;s throne, 
            to deal with all the sacred mysteries and proffer them to others, 
            something which the Christian religion does not allow to any woman.&#8221; 
            Such audacity was soon punished. Boccaccio says that the devil tormented 
            her with lust and &#8220;the Pope happened to become pregnant. Oh, 
            what a shameful crime!&#8221; Joan&#8217;s celebrated wisdom did not 
            help her to appreciate the implications of her condition, or even 
            to recognize the beginning of labor. During a solemn procession through 
            the streets of Rome, the pope gave birth and died in shameful agony.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
            the salacious iconography that surrounds this story, Joan frequently 
            is depicted lying in the street in a crowd of horrified onlookers, 
            a triple crown on her head and an infant emerging from beneath the 
            papal robes. Lawrence Durrell, working with a modern Greek version 
            of the legend, captured the chaotic, sacrilegious atmosphere of visual 
            representations of Joan&#8217;s travail:</font></p>
          <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 25px"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Great 
            was the consternation when a premature infant was produced from among 
            the voluminous folds of the papal vestments. The attending archdeacons 
            recoiled in horror while the great circle of worshippers pressed in 
            even closer, screaming and crossing themselves. Women climbed on the 
            backs of their menfolk for a better view, while those already mounted 
            on horses and mules stood in the saddle until the deacons were forced 
            to use their standards and crucifixes as clubs to hew a passage through 
            the mob. </font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
            uses to which the story has been put are no more edifying than its 
            iconography. It gave Boccacio an opportunity to castigate bold women, 
            but it has also been used to discredit the clergy, to make fun of 
            pious hypocrites, and to denounce the papacy and the entire Roman 
            Catholic Church.</font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
            legend of Pope Joan begins with a love affair and ends with an out-of-wedlock 
            birth, but it is not about love or sex, and Joan was not punished 
            for sexual immorality. Boccaccio&#8217;s comments and Durrell&#8217;s 
            description of the birth scene make it clear that the story is about 
            disorder, and about the filth and chaos, that ensue when objects and 
            persons and events are out of place &#8211; a woman on the throne 
            of Peter, a child in the belly of a pope, a birth in a public procession. 
            The woman whose learning and virtue carried her to the heights was 
            destroyed by motherhood. Joan was not betrayed by a lover or discovered 
            by an enemy, she was brought down by her own body, which was inherently 
            and catastrophically unfit for ecclesiastical dignity. The literary 
            and artistic images that surround the birth of her child display a 
            range of responses from hysterical laughter to horrified disgust. 
            The notion of female pope was scandalous; of a pregnant pope, ludicrous, 
            of pope giving birth, disastrous.</font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
            earliest written sources for the legend of Joan come from the eleventh 
            century, although its elaboration is the work of the Renaissance. 
            The story is set in the ninth century, party because of obscurities 
            in the historical record but also because that era was consigned to 
            the Dark Ages by Renaissance to the norm in early medieval church 
            and society, it seemed a plausible period for a female pope: the ninth 
            century deserved nothing better.<br />

            of the work of medieval midwives exists, there is much more evidence 
            from the sixteenth centuries, when male doctors and clergy began to 
            challenge their status, the effectiveness, and their near-monopoly 
            of obstetrics. Maternal and infant mortality were consistently high 
            throughout the Middle Ages and did not decline when men began to take 
            over much of the responsibility for caring for mothers and delivering 
            babies. The scanty information available about medieval midwives does 
            not provide a basis for comprehensive assessment of their work, but 
            it does not reveal that they were presented in some texts as competent 
            and essential persons. Before doctors began to compete with them and 
            witch-hunters to denounce them, midwives were not associated with 
            filth, evil, or incompetence. For centuries, women&#8212;ordinary 
            relatives and neighbors as well as midwives&#8212;provided ante- and 
            postnatal care, supervised and assisted in deliveries, and dealt with 
            primary care of the new born. Midwives supplied advice, medication, 
            and therapy for women who wanted to conceive a child or to prevent 
            conception, to fight off miscarriage or to abort an unwanted fetus. 
            Just as war was men&#8217;s business, pregnancy and birth were the 
            responsibility of women&#8212;and equally dangerous.</font> </p>

            the organization of scientific discussions in relation to the perspectives 
            and starting points of the discussants. Arguments over &#8220;one 
            seed or two seed&#8221; theories of conception were conducted for 
            the most part by learned, celibate men who ascribed all power and 
            activity to the male, reducing women&#8217;s contribution to lifeless 
            matter and questioning the very necessity of women&#8217;s existence. 
            Such theorists, even when they wrote about mothers and children, were 
            interested primarily in fathers and sons. But writers who knew, lived, 
            or worked with women [or were women] were inclined to believe that 
            both parents contributed something vital to the generation of their 
            children.</font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Texts 
            that deal with the work of midwives and nurses present a &#8220;high&#8221; 
            view of those professions. Large demands were placed on those who 
            cared for pregnant women and delivered and cared for babies, and the 
            importance of their work was recognized to a degree not apparent in 
            traditional historical and theological sources. To read denunciations 
            of midwives by witch-hunters and male doctors, and of wet nurses by 
            popes and preachers, so to listen only to men who were not at all 
            involved with women and children. The medical writings balance the 
            didactic and homiletic literature, providing a different and presumably 
            more realistic view of the medieval midwife and nurse.</font> </p>

            medieval women and Christianity we depend very much on the Lives and 
            legends of saints, stories about ordinary women are much more rare. 
            The saints were exceptional by definition, and to make sense of their 
            extraordinary experience&#8212;especially of the heroic asceticism 
            that so impressed their contemporaries&#8212;we make informed guesses 
            about the implications of being &#8220;exceptional.&#8221; The medical 
            literature helps us to see what was believed and taught about the 
            relationship of diet and rest and peace of mind to health, particularly 
            reproductive health. It is apparent at least that &#8220;health&#8221; 
            and &#8220;holiness,&#8221; as these states were defined in relation 
            to women, were markedly incompatible and that motherhood demanded 
            a regimen antipathetic to the regimen of the saint.</font> </p>

            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the fourteenth-century 
            illustrated Franciscan manuscript &#8220;Meditations on the Life of 
            Christ,&#8221; the pregnancy of Elizabeth and infancy of John the 
            Baptist inspired the devout imagination. In one picture the newborn 
            Baptist stands in a fontlike bath at center stage while his mother 
            reclines, attended by the Virgin. The author rhapsodizes over the 
            delightful scene: &#8220;Oh, the house, the room, the bed in which 
            live and rest together the mothers of two such sons, Jesus and John!&#8221; 
            Domestic arrangements, family relationships, and the behavior of infants 
            intrigued the friar-author, who observed that John was an unusually 
            wise child, preferring Mary even to his own mother: &#8220;Contemplate 
            the magnificence of the precious John! No one ever had a nurse or 
            governess like this.&#8221; The author was knowledgeable about children&#8217;s 
            needs and behavior and alert to the difficulties involved in caring 
            for them. Meditation on the flight into Egypt prompted the notion 
            that the return might have been more trying than the flight itself, 
            since Jesus had gown &#8220;too big to be easily carried and yet too 
            young to travel on His feet.&#8221; For a reader interested in children, 
            such a realistic consideration might jolt the imagination into a livelier 
            appreciation of an old story.</font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christ&#8217;s 
            birth, unlike John&#8217;s, was afflicted by poverty&#8212;or enhanced 
            by poverty, according to Franciscan values. Joseph, at first &#8220;downcaste 
            perhaps because he could not prepared what was necessary,&#8221; did 
            what he could: took hay from the manger, put it at Mary&#8217;s feet 
            to receive the Child, and sat down with his face politely turned away. 
            The birth itself was instantaneous and painless; in the view of medieval 
            theologians, realistic labor and delivery was incompatible with Mary&#8217;s 
            intact virginity. But the full humanity of mother and child, and Mary&#8217;s 
            likeness to other women, were reasserted immediately after the delivery. 
            The author noted and celebrated the physical and emotional realities 
            of motherhood: &#8220;Unable to contain herself, the mother stooped 
            to pick Him up, embraced Him tenderly and, guided by the Holy Spirit 
            placed Him in her lap and began to wash Him with her milk, her breasts 
            filled by heaven.&#8221; Like a midwife, the Holy Spirit instructs 
            the new mother and fills her breasts. Mary&#8217;s motherhood is rich 
            with human feeling as well as sacred significance.</font> </p>

            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the sixteenth 
            and seventeenth centuries, male physicians, male midwives, and male 
            authorities on gynecology, obstetrics, and infant care began to compete 
            with women in the traditional female work of health care for mothers 
            and children. Midwives still worked in villages everywhere and were 
            trained, licensed, and employed by German cities, nevertheless, the 
            long process of denunciation of their competence and contempt for 
            their persons was under way. It became commonplace for midwives to 
            be suspected of every kind of crime and to be blamed for an infant&#8217;s 
            deformity or a mother&#8217;s death. Traditionally, they had helped 
            women with contraception and abortion and with problems of infertility; 
            such activities were now likely to be identified as immoral or criminal 
            and to be prosecuted. There is no evidence that the skill or dedication 
            of midwives deteriorated or that their rate of failure and success 
            altered; what did change was attitudes towards birth, toward families, 
            and toward women who held responsibility for the well-being of mothers 
            and children.</font> </p>
          <p align="justify" class="default"> The image of the midwife was affected 
            also by the feverish acceleration of trials for witchcraft after the 
            middle of the sixteenth century. Many medieval Christians had believed 
            in witches and feared sorcery and harmful spells, but their Church 
            had discouraged such beliefs and fears as superstition. The Church 
            did not approve or sponsor witch-hunting until late in the fifteenth 
            century, when Innocent VIII published a bull identifying a &#8220;present 
            danger&#8221; from witches and authorizing two Dominicans to proceed 
            against them. The text produced by Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger, 
            the infamous Malleus maleficarum of 1486, became extremely influential 
            in the sixteenth century; five hundred years later, the bizarre fixations 
            of its authors still provoke a horrified fascination with witches 
            and witch-hunters.</p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kramer 
            and Sprenger identified witchcraft with heresy, and they pronounced 
            authoritatively that most witches were women because of women&#8217;s 
            inherent wickedness. They also identified that most dangerous work 
            of witches as the evil power they exercised over sex and procreation, 
            &#8220;first by inciting the minds of men to inordinate passion, second, 
            by obstructing their generative force, third, by removing the members 
            accommodated to that act, fourth, by changing men into beasts by their 
            magic art, fifth by destroying the generative force in women; sixth, 
            by procuring abortion, seventh, by offering children to devils.&#8221; 
            More than 80 percent of the persons tried and executed for witchcraft 
            were women; most of them were poor and elderly, and a significant 
            number had worked as midwives. The image of the witch as anti-wife 
            and anti-mother&#8212;a sexual threat instead of a helpmate and a 
            frightful danger to reproduction and the Christianization of children&#8212;was 
            transformed from a clerical fantasy to a murderous reality.</font></p>
