        Birth is a Force That Gives Us Meaning<br />
        <strong><font size="2">Ann Davenport</font></strong><br />
        <br />
        <font size="2">Inside the adobe home of a rural Bolivian village, I sit 
        on a wooden chair and wait. In this small, candle-lit room, I smell the 
        familiar odors of sweat and amniotic fluid. With her skirts hiked up to 
        her hips and a wool blanket wrapped around her for warmth, a laboring 
        woman fixes her gaze and her energy beyond anything the other partera 
        (midwife) or I can see or understand. The village partera sits in back 
        of the woman on the bed, supporting her. She and I remain quiet. We listen 
        to the woman&#8217;s groans and grunts and occasional growls. We don&#8217;t 
        interrupt. We tend to breathe to match her rhythms, but we don&#8217;t 
        talk, except to soothe her with our cooing words of encouragement. And 
        we wait. </font></font></font> </p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Soon, 
        the woman&#8217;s hands turn white with a final gasp and grip. She leans 
        forward, pinches her eyes closed and gives a low, rumbling sound known 
        best to midwives and mothers &#8211; the baby will come now. The head 
        comes out, turns while the shoulders accommodate the pelvis, and with 
        a rush of warm water, a new life plops onto a clean towel between my gloved 
        hands and mother&#8217;s legs. The baby girl opens her eyes and looks 
        around, then gives a pouty little cry. I want louder lung exercise, so 
        I dry her roughly to stimulate a bawl. That always works. The mother sits 
        back onto her haunches while the partera helps me with the baby and placenta. 
        I tie and cut the cord, wrap the little girl in a fresh towel, and give 
        her to her mother to hold next to her bare breast. Everyone except the 
        newborn is smiling.</font></font></p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">The 
        first voice the baby hears is the low cooing from her mother, &#8220;Welcome, 
        <em>mi amor</em>. We have waited so long for you.&#8221;</font></font></p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Then 
        she looks up to us with the glowing knowledge that new mothers everywhere 
        have and says, &#8220;Look! I have given birth! I feel like God at this 
        moment!&#8221; I have heard that same comment everywhere I&#8217;ve worked 
        as a midwife, in every culture, in every country, in every language; woman 
        is the creator, and she knows it.</font></font></p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">What 
        she said in Spanish for &#8220;I have given birth&#8221; was, literally, 
        &#8220;He dado a luz!&#8221; The infinitive verb form dar a Luz means 
        to give to the light &#8211; as in &#8220;Let there be light&#8221;. This 
        nineteen year old rural, illiterate Bolivian woman knew how it feels to 
        be a giver of life, a bringer of light, united to and connected with every 
        other mother throughout time. She walked the fine line between life and 
        death and became transformed, and reborn, by her own miracle. </font></font> 
      </p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Any 
        midwife who has time and the right circumstances (I mean outside a patriarchal 
        hospital system) may be privileged to participate in this transformation, 
        this birthing of woman to mother. Midwives know motherhood is a gift to 
        the light of consciousness for all humanity, and we recognize it as the 
        connecting force that maintains the race. Birth is a force that gives 
        us meaning, just as war is a force that gives men meaning and becomes 
        their manner of transformation (see philosopher Chris Hedges&#8217; provocative 
        works online or in print about the culture and transformative addictive 
        powers of war and killing in a patriarchal society).</font></font></p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Throughout 
        history, women were known as guardians of the race not only due to their 
        sacrificial capacity to educate and rear children, but also for their 
        magical capacity to create a new human by holding blood inside the womb 
        for nine months. &#8220;From the earliest human culture,&#8221; writes 
        Barbara Walker, &#8220;the mysterious magic of creation was thought to 
        reside in the blood women gave forth in apparent harmony with the moon, 
        and which was sometimes retained in the womb to &#8220;coagulate&#8221; 
        into a baby. Men regarded this blood with holy dread, as the life-essence, 
        inexplicably shed without pain, wholly foreign to male experience.<sup>2</sup>&#8221; 
        From Aristotle to Pliny to medical school teachings up to the 18th century, 
        the prenatal function of menstrual blood was believed to be &#8220;the 
        material substance of generation.&#8221; <sup>3</sup></font></font></p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Most 
        authorities now agree that not only &#8220;uncivilized&#8221; races today, 
        but certainly all the world&#8217;s people in the prehistoric period, 
        knew nothing of man&#8217;s part in the process of reproduction. It was 
        believed that only women held the divine power to give life. Yet, once 
        men discovered their role in the baby business (or probably learned the 
        truth from women who were inventors of calendars based on moon phases), 
        God suddenly became a man, woman became a mere &#8220;vessel&#8221; for 
        seed (of God or of man &#8211; see &#8220;virgin birth&#8221;), and the 
        business of economic heredity was born. The rest, as they say, is history. 
        For the past 5,000 years we have all been transformed by patriarchal, 
        god-centered cultures based on might and revenge, division and conquest, 
        submission and fear, authority and dominance. </font></font> </p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Fortunately, 
        5,000 years is only a small (and bloody) chapter in the human story of 
        millions of years, a story that begins with a new page every minute of 
        every day when a woman trusts herself to give birth and recognizes herself 
        as Creator. Sadly, this story doesn&#8217;t unfold within most patriarchal 
        hospitals or clinics, where a system of hierarchy dictates the birthing 
        account, and where the birthing woman is silenced for her own good, in 
        order to better &#8220;manage&#8221; the birth, dictated by protocols, 
        technology and fear. </font></font> </p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">And 
        managed that birth must be! It&#8217;s certainly not up the mother where, 
        when, or how to give birth. Sometimes, it&#8217;s not up to her where 
        or when to even get pregnant. Pregnancy and childbirth, always a transformative 
        process, must now be entrusted into the maw of technology, the new god. 
        Women have gone from creating life to being &#8220;delivered&#8221; of 
        their &#8220;product of conception.&#8221; </font></font> </p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Marsden 
        Wagner, a perinatal epidemiologist, former head of Maternal and Child 
        Health for the European Office of the World Health Organization (WHO), 
        and renowned promoter for the humanization of childbirth, says the following 
        about giving birth back to the mothers, where it belongs, instead of leaving 
        in the un-human hands of technology: &#8220;Humanizing birth means understanding 
        that the woman giving birth is a human being, not a machine and not just 
        a container for making babies. Showing women---half of all people---that 
        they are inferior and inadequate by taking away their power to give birth 
        is a tragedy for all society.&#8221;</font></font></p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Anthropologist 
        Robbie Davis-Floyd (University of Texas at Austin) has dedicated her professional 
        career to enlightening us with chronicles about fear-based modern medicine 
        and trust-based childbirth. Every midwife and mother would agree, she 
        writes, that technology can be a life saver in the right circumstances, 
        and none of us disagree with the marvels of modern medical treatments. 
        Every mother and midwife would also recognize Robbie&#8217;s discourse 
        on our current technocratic model of childbirth, based on the construct 
        of separation, versus our longed-for humanistic model based on connection. 
        (See side box)</font></font></p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">How 
        have we come to find ourselves so disconnected from our humanity, and 
        how is that disconnect related to a fear-filled childbirth? For millions 
        of years, the act of birth was centered on the woman, and not the person 
        who &#8220;delivered&#8221; her. Many of us know that the separation of 
        woman from Creator occurred with the suppression of our own natural Goddess 
        imagery in favor of an imposed masculine, alien, hierarchical system &#8211; 
        a belief system that imposes authority from outside instead of from within; 
        in other words, from Jewish, Christian and Muslim credence (among other 
        male god-centered religions). Humanity was taught to believe the stories 
        of a vengeful god, of a righteous and punishing religious tradition, and 
        to believe a doctrine based on fear, on separation, and on the concept 
        of sin/redemption by earned affection.</font></font></p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">We 
        also have to believe that man was made in god&#8217;s image, that woman 
        was made to serve both god and man, and that woman is a carrier for this 
        god/man&#8217;s seed &#8211; with woman as mal-functioning machine and 
        man as sole creator because he is the son of god. Five thousand years, 
        friends. But not five million. And not during the five minutes when we 
        may experience our baby slipping from within us &#8211; if we are allowed 
        to experience it. </font></font> </p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">No 
        ethics and no religion can change that holy experience, which some men 
        may be privileged to witness. During that birth, a baby is born, a mother 
        is born, a father is born, and a family is born. Birth is a force that 
        gives us meaning, that connects and unites us, that transforms humanity, 
        and that lights the way to recognize the Goddess in each of us. Hail Mary, 
        mother of gods, thank you for giving us the light of consciousness to 
        know you &#8211; to know that we are in you, you are in us, and we are 
        all One.</font></font></p>
