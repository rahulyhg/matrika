                        suppressed, is the manner in which the Hindu of all classes permits his much-coveted

                        in various parts of India. These are doing excellent work, mostly gynecological.
                        But they are few, relatively to the work to be done, nor could the vast majority
                        of Indian women, in their present state of development, be induced to use a hospital,
                        were it at their very door.</font></p>
                <p align="justify">
                    <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What the typical Indian woman wants
                        in her hour of trail is the thing to which she is historically used&#8212;the midwife&#8212;the
                        dhai. And the dhai is a creature that must indeed be seen to be credited.</font></p>
                <p align="justify">
                    <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the Hindu code, a woman
                        in childbirth and in convalescence there from is ceremonially unclean, contaminating
                        all that she touches. Therefore only those become dhais who are themselves of the
                        unclean, &#8220;untouchable&#8221; class, the class whose filthy habits will be
                        adduced by the orthodox Hindu as his good and sufficient reason for barring them
                        from contact with himself. Again according to the Hindu code, a woman in childbirth,
                        like the new-born child itself, is peculiarly susceptible to the &#8220;evil eye.&#8221;
                        Therefore no woman whose child has died, no one who has had an abortion, may, in
                        many parts of India, serve as dhai, because of the malice or jealously that may
                        secretly inspire her. Neither may any widow so serve, being herself a thing of evil
                        omen. Not all of these disqualifications obtain everywhere. But each holds in large
                        sections.</font></p>

                        necessary for the work. As a calling, it descends in families. At the death of a
                        dhai, her daughter or daughter-in-law may adopt it, beginning at once to practice
                        even though she has never seen a confinement in all her life.1 But other women,
                        outside the line of descent, may also take on the work and, if they are properly
                        beyond the lines of the taboos, will find ready employment without any sort of preparation

                        of diseased cases that have come into her practice. And so, at her dirtiest, a bearer

                        further to keep away the air. Then, to make darkness darker, she lights the tiniest
                        glim&#8212;a bit of cord in a bit of oil, or a little kerosene lamp without a chimney,
                        smoking villainously. Next, she makes a small charcoal fire in a pan beneath the

                        tossed upon this coal-pot, as I entered the room, a handful of some special vile-smelling

                        sightless eyes out over the stink-cloud she had raised. But it was not she who ran
                        to quench the flame that caught in the bed and went writhing up the body of her
                        unconscious patient. She was too blind&#8212;too dull of sense to see or to feel

                        contaminations, into the patient&#8217;s body, pulling and twisting at what she
                        finds there.3 If the delivery is long delayed and difficult, a second or a third
                        dhai may be called in, if the husband of the patient will sanction the expense,
                        and the child may be dragged forth in detached sections &#8211; a leg or an arm
                        torn off at a time.4<br />
                        Again to quote from a medical woman:5<br />
                        <br />
                        One often sees ion cases of contracted pelvis due to osteomalacia, if there seems
                        no chance of the head passing down [that the dhai] attempts to draw on the limbs,
                        and, if possible, breaks them off. She prefers to extract the child by main force,
                        and the patient in such cases is badly torn, often into her bladder, with the resulting
                        large vesico-vaginal fistulae so common in India women, and which cause them too
                        much misery.</font></p>

                        is the code&#8212;and the dhai resorts to all her traditions. She kneads the patient
                        with her fists; stands her against the wall and butts her with her head; props her
                        upright on the bare ground, seizes her hand and shoves against her thighs with gruesome
                        bare feet,6 until, so the doctors state, the patient&#8217;s flesh is often torn
                        to ribbons by the dhai&#8217;s long ragged toe-nails. Or, she lays the woman flat
                        and walks up and down her body, like one treading grapes. Also, she makes balls
                        of strange substances, such as hollyhock roots, or dirty string, or rags full of
                        quince-seeds; or earth, or earth mixed with cloves, butter and marigold flowers;
                        or nuts, or spices&#8212;and irritant&#8212;and thrusts them into the uterus, to
                        hasten the event. In some parts of the country, goats&#8217; hair, scorpions&#8217;

                        the family utensils from pollution. But in any case it enjoys the prestige of an
                        ancient tenet to which the economical spirit of the household lends a spontaneous

                        of India are either too small boned or too internally misshapen and diseased to
                        give normal birth to a child, but require surgical aid. It may safely be said that
                        all these cases die by slow torture, unless they receive the care of British or
                        American woman doctor, or of an Indian woman, British-trained. 14 Such care, even
                        though it be at hand, is often denied the sufferer, either by the husband or by

                        dirty room, often with no window. If there is one it is stopped up. Puerperal fever
                        is supposed to be caused by fresh air. The remaining air is vitiated by the presence
                        of a charcoal fire burning in a pan, and on a charpoy [cot] or on the floor is the
                        woman. With her are one or two dirty old women, their clothes filthy, their hands
                        begrimed with dirt, their heads alive with vermin. They explain that they are midwives,
                        that the patient has been in labour three days, and they cannot get the child out.
                        They are rubbing their hands on the floor previous to making another effort. On
                        inspection we find the vulva swollen and torn. They tell us, yes, it is a bad case
                        and they have had to use both feet and hands in their effort to deliver her&#8230;
                        Chloroform is given and the child extracted with forceps. We are sure to find hollyhock
                        roots which have been pushed inside the mother, sometimes string and a dirty rag

                <p align="justify">
                    <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A wealthy Hindu, a graduate of an
                        Indian University and a lecturer himself, a man who is highly educated, calls us
                        to his house, as his wife has been delivered of a child and has fever&#8230;. We
                        find that [the dhai] had no disinfectants as they would have cost her about Rs.
                        3 [one dollar, American], and the fee she will get on the case is only Re. 1 and
                        a few dirty clothes. The patient is lying on a heap of cast-off and dirty clothes,
                        an old waistcoat, an English railway rug, a piece of water-proof packing from a
                        parcel, half a stained and dirty shirt of her husband&#8217;s. There are no sheets
                        or clean rags of any kind. As her husband tells me: &#8220;We shall give her clean
                        things on the fifth day, but not now; that is our custom.&#8221;<br />
                        That woman, in spite of all we could do, died of septicemia contracted either from
                        the dirty clothing which is saved from one confinement in the family to another
                        [unwashed], or from the dhai, who did her best in the absence of either hot water,
                        soap, nail-brush or disinfectants.<br />
                        Evidence is in hand of educated, traveled and well-born Indians, themselves holders
                        of European university degrees, who permit their wives to undergo this same inheritance
                        of darkness. The case may be cited of an Indian medical man, holding an English
                        medical man, holding an English University&#8217;s Ph.D. and M.D. degrees, considered
                        to be exceptionally able and brilliant and now actually in charge of a government
                        center for the training of dhais in modern midwifery. His own young wife being recently
                        confined, he yielded to the pressure of the elder women of his family and called
                        in an old-school dhai, dirty and ignorant as the rest, to attend her. The wife died
                        of puerperal fever; the child died in the birth. &#8220;When we have the spectacle
                        of even educated Indians with English degrees allowing their wives and children
                        to be killed off like flies by ignorant midwives,&#8221; says Doctor Vaughan again,
                        &#8220;we can faintly imagine the sufferings of their humbler sisters.&#8221;</font></p>

                            midwifery is extremely difficult to get, for the reason that Indian women can rarely
                            be persuaded to come to hospitals open to medical men. With the exception of certain
                            extremely limited opportunities, therefore, the Indian student must get his genecology
                            from books. Even though he learns it abroad, he has little or no opportunity to
                            practice it. Sometimes, it is true, the western-diplomaed Indian doctor will conduct
                            a labor case by sitting on the far side of a heavy curtain calling out advice based
                            on the statements shouted across by the dhai who is handling the patient. But this
                            scarcely constitutes &#8220;practice&#8221; as the world is generally meant.<br />
