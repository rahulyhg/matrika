            In a survey of 3756 birth records, researchers sought to identify 
            links between maternal position during spontaneous midwife-attended 
            birth and the incidence of perineal tears. Factors evaluated in mothers 
            needing postnatal perineal sutures were maternal age, first vaginal 
            delivery, induction of labor, regional anesthesia, newborn birth weight 
            greater than 3500 grams, deflexed fetal head and absence of occipital 
            anterior fetal position. The need for sutures and the effect of birth 
            positions were compared for each factor. A semirecumbent position 
            had been used by nearly 66% of the women, and that position correlated 
            with the 44.5% incidence of sutures. All-fours position was associated 
            with reduced need for sutures. The most significant factors that correlated 
            to perineal trauma included first vaginal birth, regional anesthesia, 
            deflexed fetal head and newborn weight of more than 3500 grams.</font></font></p>
