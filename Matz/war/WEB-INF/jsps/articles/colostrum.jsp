            Colostrum is low in fat, but high in carbohydrates and protein. It 
            is also very rich in vitamin A, a micronutrient that is essential 
            to good health, particularly in reventing blindness, as well as in 
            preventing infection.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            Colostrum contains antibodies that are effective in fighting infection 
            and keeping the baby healthy. It is easily digestible, making it the 
            perfect first food for a baby. Its laxative effect helps the baby 
            pass early stools, which aids in the excretion of excess bilirubin 
            and helps prevent jaundice.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            The first few days of breastfeeding are probably the most important 
            for a baby, and because the baby's stomach is very small he or she 
            will be able to consume only a small amount of protein at a time. 
            As a result, the baby will need to be fed nine or more times in a 
            24-hour period.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            Colostrum acts like a natural oral vaccine because it contains large 
            quantities of an antibody called secretory immunoglobin A (IgA). IgA 
            protects the baby's mucous membranes in the throat, lungs and intestines 
            from infection. Colostrum also has high concentrations of white blood 
            cells, called leukocytes, which fight bacteria and viruses.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            Colostrum is especially important in the gastrointestinal tract. A 
            newborn's intestines are very permeable. Colostrum helps seal the 
            permeable intestines by creating a barrier that helps prevent foreign 
            substances from penetrating and possibly sensitizing a baby to foods 
            the mother has eaten.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            While these effects continue once the colostrum changes to milk, the 
        
            immunological response to viruses and bacteria is not as powerful 
            as in the
            beginning. However, the effects of the initial colostrum are long-lasting.
            Studies have shown that children who are breastfed rather than formula-fed 
            have
            a lower frequency of allergic, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
            and
            lymphomas in their later life when compared with children who have 
            been
            formula-fed after birth.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            Besides these effects, colostrum has a positive effect on blood sugar 
            and aids 
            in development of the heart, lungs and brain.</font></font></p>

            In Brazil, where enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) diarrhea 
            is a<br />
            leading cause of morbidity and mortality in newborns, a study used 
            Western blot<br />
            analysis to determine the extent to which IgA in colostrum is reactive 
            with<br />
            enteropathogenic E. coli proteins. The analyses revealed that the 
            colostrum<br />

            all the<br />

            maternal<br />
            antibodies in colostrum may protect infants from E. coli infection

            A study determined that the anti-infective factors in the colostrums

            The 25<br />

            levels. In the mothers of preterm infants, the concentrations of total
