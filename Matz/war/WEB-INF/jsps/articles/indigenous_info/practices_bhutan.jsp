	<h1>Childbirth Practices in Bhutan</h1>
	<h2>By Judy Cameron</h2>
	<h3>BSc(Hons) RGN</h3>
	<br />
	I have recently returned from the Buddhist Kingdom of Bhutan, a tiny
	Himalayan country sandwiched between China and India. Here I spent 2
	years, my time divided between the capital and a remote community near
	the Tibetan border. <br />
	<br />
	Bhutan's economy and the majority of its population are essentially
	rural. In 1993 about 90% of births took place in the home (Levitt et al
	1993). However, this situation is rapidly changing as more and more
	people migrate to the urban centres. <br />
	<br />
	Until recently, Bhutan boasted a low and static population of less than
	a million in a country about the size of Switzerland. However,
	improvements in health care and education have meant a healthier and
	growing population. Maternal mortality has practically halved since 1984
	and infant mortality is down from 102 to 71 per 1,000 live births
	(UNICEF 1999). With a growth rate of 3.1%, the population is expected to
	double over the next 20 years (Planning Commission Secretariat 1999). <br />
	<br />
	Twelve years ago, I came to Bhutan as a VSO nurse where I spent 2 years
	working in the main regional hospital in the capital, Thimphu. When I
	returned in 1998 my husband's work was to take us away from the capital
	for a total of 6 months to the remote community of Laya near the Tibetan
	border. When I requested permission to investigate childbirth practice
	in this region, the Ministry of Health (Royal Government of Bhutan)
	expressed its interest and asked if I would submit a short report. <br />
	<br />
	Laya is a relatively isolated, culturally distinct community of about
	850 people spread over 6 villages situated some 4 days walk from the
	nearest road. However, since the mid 90's there has been considerable
	expansion of local government services in the area including a primary
	school, a Basic Health Unit (BHU) with Health Assistant (HA)1, and
	periodic visits from water and sanitation engineers. In the winter and
	spring months small groups of tourists trek to the area, staying no more
	than a day or two. The Layaps are, therefore, well able to retain their
	traditions and identity. <br />
	<br />
	<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
	Traditionally, women in Bhutan do not make public the fact that they are
	pregnant (UNICEF 1996). The women I spoke to in Laya told me that they
	would only tell their husband and mother. To broadcast the news more
	widely would invoke bad luck. Evil spirits might know of the pregnancy
	and seek to harm the unborn child. <br />
	<br />
	In fact, one woman gave birth to, what she described as, a "dead baby"
	the previous year. The woman accounted for her misfortune by relating
	how she had gone to drink at a "poison" house where evil spirits must
	have resided. It is not certain whether this baby had died at the point
	of birth (neonatal death) or had died some time before the birth
	(stillbirth). In any case the death did not appear on the annual
	statistics. Interestingly, there appeared to be no statistics on
	miscarriage in Laya either and I suspect the reluctance to talk about
	pregnancy and childbirth goes a long way towards explaining this gap. A
	further consequence of this taboo is that folk knowledge about both
	procedures and precautions may be poorly communicated (Wikan and Barth
	1989). More recent reports confirm that childbirth is still a taboo
	subject and there is still little knowledge about the position of the
	child in the womb, birth procedures, risk signs and precautions (UNICEF
	1996). <br />
	<br />
	In spite of this reluctance to talk about pregnancy, antenatal
	attendance in Bhutan is estimated to be around 70% (Levitt 1993),
	although in Laya there is still an unwillingness to attend. The BHU was
	set up only 3 years ago, and the annual statistics suggest that more and
	more women are coming forward for antenatal care. In fact, the woman who
	had lost her baby told me that next time she would go to the antenatal
	clinic to make sure that the baby was all right. <br />
	<br />
	Levitt (1993) considered the quality and quantity of antenatal care to
	be exceptional in Bhutan, considering the geographic, transportation and
	communication constraints within the country. However, she noted that,
	although the physical assessment and provision of service was strong, it
	was not supported by adequate and/or appropriate health education.
	Fortunately this situation is now changing. <br />
	<br />
	However, it is still apparent that health care personnel require support
	and encouragement in this area. The HA in Laya endeavoured to hold
	health education classes on a monthly basis. However, he was often
	unable to do this when all the women were engaged in agricultural work
	and yak rearing. Health education videos were shown periodically at the
	local school, using a portable generator. No discussion preceded or
	followed the health videos at the event I witnessed when the highlight
	of the evening was a Hindi movie. <br />
	<br />
	Levitt (1993) suggested that in rural areas, more training and
	responsibility should be given to the Village Health Worker (VHW) to do
	antenatal examinations and deliveries and to conduct health education
	classes. However, more recent research from the World Health
	Organisation (WHO) in Nepal would argue against this. A recent
	evaluation has been carried out on the impact of traditional birth
	attendants (TBA's) - women who have undergone some basic training in
	antenatal care and delivery. Their findings showed no significant
	reduction in the maternal mortality figures. It may, therefore, not be
	appropriate to train VHWs to assume the role of a TBA but it would seem
	useful to continue the practice of training VHWs from the community to
	conduct health education. <br />
	<br />
	In Laya all 5 VHWs are men. Dr. Pem Namgyal's study (1998) suggested
	that women preferred to have a female health worker present at delivery.
	Levitt (1993) found that the uptake for antenatal care was high in the
	region where the Trained Mother Program2 was in operation. It is
	reassuring to know that in Bhutan, the percentage of women VHWs is
	rising. They are trained to conduct health education and carry a small
	stock of medicines but they are not trained to attend a woman in labour.
	<br />
	<br />
	<h2>The Birth</h2>
	Maternal mortality is still high in Bhutan (380 per 100,000 babies
	born). Unlike in Thimphu where the majority of women give birth in
	hospital, in Laya I found that childbirth was much more under the
	control of the women. Pasang had her first child in 1996 when she was 17
	years old. Her second pregnancy resulted in a stillbirth or neonatal
	death. Both births were very similar but it was the birth of her first
	child that she focused upon. <br />
	<br />
	She was making dinner when she realised she was in labour. She felt she
	could no longer continue with her work so she went to her mother's house
	where her mother told her to kneel down and lean forward over a
	horizontal pole. Only her mother and husband were present at the actual
	birth but it was her mother who guided her and explained what to do. It
	seems that this knowledge is passed on from generation to generation
	only at the time of birth. <br />
	<br />
	Pasang and her husband described the labour as lasting no longer than 2
	hours with the waters breaking just before the second stage. Pasang had
	remained upright until it was no longer possible. She then enlisted the
	help of gravity, taking the pressure away from the perineum so that she
	did not tear. <br />
	<br />
	Although Pasang describes her labour as lasting only 2 hours, it is not
	clear whether she felt any discomfort earlier in the day which she did
	not associate with her labour. This area of women's knowledge and
	perception of labour and its various stages demands further research. <br />
	<br />
	After the baby was born, the cord was tied off with sheep's wool and the
	cord cut with a metal sickle. Asked whether the sickle had been cleaned
	beforehand, neither Pasang, nor her husband could remember. There is a
	temptation to presume that they did not clean the implement but, since
	this part of the interview was conducted through an interpreter, a
	misunderstanding could have arisen. <br />
	<br />
	Pasang and her husband then waited for the placenta to be delivered.
	This only seemed to take a few minutes. Pasang then began to breastfeed
	her baby immediately. <br />
	<br />
	Pasang described her second labour as being similar to the first. Her
	husband said the baby was a "good size", similar to their first baby,
	but sadly it was dead. It is not known whether the baby was simply slow
	to breathe and could have been resuscitated, or whether the baby had
	been dead for some time. If the problem had been one in which the baby
	was slow to breathe, a delay in cutting the cord might have ensured the
	infant continued to receive oxygenated blood from the placenta, which
	might have saved its life (AIMS 1995). <br />
	<br />
	I also talked to the HA in Laya who is married to a local woman. She was
	up in the mountains herding yak when she first became aware of her
	labour pains. By the evening she was back down in the village with her
	husband. Here she was able to rest and gave birth early the next
	morning. Her husband attended the birth and he told his wife to recline
	for the actual delivery. After the baby was born he clamped the cord
	prior to what he described as an unmanaged, physiological third stage.
	Such intervention, of course, immediately renders it a managed third
	stage. <br />
	<br />
	It appears that this was the way he had been taught during his training
	and yet it has been well documented that premature clamping and cutting
	of the umbilical cord can have a number of undesirable side effects.
	These include: reducing the volume of blood the baby receives by about
	100ml; prolonging placental separation by delaying retraction of the
	uterus; increasing blood loss; and severing the baby's lifeline -
	especially crucial if the baby is slow to breathe (AIMS 1995). <br />
	<br />
	The health statistics collected in Laya over the last 3 years are not
	always reliable and at least one neonatal and one maternal death have
	gone unreported. To what extent the practice of premature cutting of the
	cord was responsible, it is impossible to know. However, Levitt (1993)
	in her study of childbirth in rural Bhutan also found that in nearly 90%
	of homebirths the cord was cut immediately after the baby was born. She
	added that both untrained and trained attendants alike cut the cord
	immediately following the birth. <br />
	<br />
	There appears to be a gap in knowledge within both the community and
	among health workers. Since the HA's are responsible for training the
	VHW's and facilitating childbirth education in the community, it would
	seem a priority to update the skills of health workers in this area.
	Many health workers carry oxytocic drugs with them in order to manage
	the third stage. Others may well be allowing a woman to go through a
	physiological third stage in the correct way. But it is not known how
	widespread this practice is. <br />
	<br />
	It would also seem appropriate to update the in-service training of HA's
	so that they can assist the delivery of a woman wishing to kneel or
	stand. This is traditionally the position adopted by the Northern
	Bhutanese. One reason women may be reluctant to call in the HA is
	through fear of having to lie down (Pem Namgyal 1998). The recently
	published Standards of Midwifery Practice (Royal Government of Bhutan
	1999), a research-based policy document, seeks to change practice by
	addressing this problem. <br />
	<br />
	There still remained a question in my mind about the length of labour.
	Pasang described it as lasting only 2 hours. Kinley, the Health
	Assistant's wife, described it as lasting longer. Although her labour
	started during the day, she was able to go to bed and sleep before
	waking early the next morning to deliver. The way these women described
	their births and the way the women from Thimphu described theirs
	differed both in terms of length and the pain experienced. There are
	many differences between these two groups such as their language, local
	beliefs, education and lifestyle which could influence both their
	perception of labour and the way they describe it. However, it is
	interesting to consider lifestyle as a single factor. <br />
	<br />
	The Layap women work incredibly hard. It is they who do much of the
	physical work on the land. They look after the yak on the higher slopes,
	they sow, weed and harvest the crops. Some work remains exclusively in
	the domain of men such as ploughing but many jobs are shared with the
	menfolk such as collecting firewood, threshing and preparing the mustard
	and barley. However, it is usually the women who collect the water from
	a stream or piped water supply. This involves carrying 20 litres at a
	time, usually on their backs. The women are, therefore, extremely strong
	and fit. <br />
	<br />
	In the home, as in any traditional Bhutanese house, the business of
	daily living takes place at floor level. Hence, when sitting down women
	almost invariably sit cross-legged. Cooking involves much bending from
	the hips (the same body action and movement used in the fields). By
	bending from the hips, the lower back is protected and the hamstrings
	lengthen and become strong. This lifestyle has implications for the
	position of the fetus. One of the reasons for such a high percentage of
	obstetrically managed births in the West (and possibly in Thimphu)
	appears to be the high number of fetal vertex malpositions. Many of
	these have turned out to be the occipito-lateral/posterior position, a
	position nurtured by the more sedentary life of the West, but rarely
	seen among women living in traditional societies (Sutton 1996). <br />
	<br />
	Goldsmith (1990) further points out that once women from traditional
	societies migrate to the urban centres, they begin to adopt a less
	active lifestyle. Very quickly they begin to have more trouble in
	childbirth than in the traditional society they have left behind. This
	appears to be happening in Bhutan. Far fewer women living in the capital
	now work on the land. Their lifestyle is more sedentary although sitting
	cross-legged is still part of their way of life. It would seem that
	being strong and agile favours a good birth. <br />
	<br />
	It could also be argued that women in the capital are better nourished
	and are having larger babies which may be producing new problems, thus
	increasing the need for Caesarean section. The number of women referred
	to Thimphu from the districts also distorts the figures for length of
	labour, number of assisted deliveries and Caesarean section. All these
	factors need to be taken into account and would require further research
	before any firm conclusions can be drawn. <br />
	<br />
	<h2>"Dip" or Ritual Pollution</h2>
	Wikan and Barth (1989) described a form of ritual pollution, very
	prevalent in Northern Bhutan, known as birth dip. In Laya, the people I
	spoke to referred to this ritual pollution which peaks at the time of
	birth. Its effects last for 3 days and are removed by a cleansing ritual
	performed on the fourth day. So in many districts all who can flee the
	house of birth do so and do not return until the cleansing rites on the
	fourth day. Neighbours and kinspeople who elsewhere might have
	functioned as birth assistants or midwives avoid any association with
	the birth. This may account for the lack of traditional midwives and the
	practice of husband and/or mother being the sole birth attendants across
	most of Northern Bhutan. <br />
	<br />
	The Layap women also believe that if someone outside the immediate
	family sees a labouring woman, then the baby will not survive. The HA
	described the puja or Labsang which was performed by the local lama a
	week after the baby was born. Butter lamps were lit, rice was put on a
	plate as an offering while the lama circled the house sprinkling water
	and repeating: "Sang say lo". A rough translation of this was given to
	be: "Let the baby be free from disease, free from other people's bad
	words and free from 'dip'". It was especially important that the HA be
	seen to do this otherwise people would not come to the BHU again. If, in
	future, they went for treatment and failed to get better or got worse,
	they would say they got the "dip" from the HA. <br />
	<br />
	Although "dip" is often referred to as a form of ritual pollution,
	similar practices have been described by early anthropologists. One such
	writer (von Furer-Haimendorf 1969) proposed that the idea underlying the
	custom of excluding strangers from the house was more to do with
	protecting the newborn child from infection. I would add to that and say
	that the ideal environment should be quiet and intimate. Intrusions from
	outsiders can interrupt the labour by interfering with hormone release.
	Furthermore, given that the period of "dip" appears to be around 7 days,
	this ties in with the length of time it can take to establish
	breastfeeding and ensure some rest for the mother (Goldsmith 1990).
	"Dip" could, therefore, have arisen for very practical reasons. <br />
	<br />
	<h2>Care of the Newborn and Breastfeeding</h2>
	Although both Pasang and Kinley said that they breastfed within half an
	hour of the birth, the HA maintained that this was not common practice.
	He had observed that most women wait anything from several hours to
	days. Levitt (1993) found that half of the women in her study delayed
	breastfeeding until "the milk came in". Goldsmith (1990) comments also
	on the lack of knowledge concerning the value of colostrum among
	traditional societies. This is obviously one very important area for
	health education. <br />
	<br />
	The extent to which mothers exclusively breastfeed during the first 4
	months is still not clear. Levitt (1993) found that only 33% of mothers
	exclusively breastfed their babies in the early months. Another more
	recent study in eastern Bhutan found that 90% of mothers breastfed for
	the first 2 months only (Health Division, 3rd Draft 2000). <br />
	<br />
	Levitt (1993) found that butter was the most common substance fed to
	newborns. However, in Laya it appears that kapchi (roasted barley flour)
	is fed to the baby within the first few days of birth. It is often mixed
	with butter tea and then transferred mouth-to-mouth from the mother to
	the infant. This practice continues, with the amount of kapchi
	increasing gradually over the months. <br />
	<br />
	This early introduction of weaning foods in Laya is not only traditional
	but is also probably related to the lifestyle and work of the mother.
	After about 2 weeks she returns to the fields, leaving her infant with
	the grandparents. The grandparents will feed the baby butter tea, hot
	water or cow's milk mouth-to-mouth if it wakes up hungry. Kapchi mixed
	with any of these will take longer to go through the baby's alimentary
	tract and will keep hunger at bay for a longer period until the mother
	returns. Although Pasang said that she returned after 1½ hours to
	breastfeed, it is not known whether all mothers are able to be such good
	timekeepers. After about 4 or 5 months when the baby is bigger and
	stronger, the mother takes her baby to the fields with her. <br />
	<br />
	Although it is recommended that all babies should be exclusively
	breastfed for at least 4 months (WHO/UNICEF 1989), further research is
	necessary. First, it needs to be ascertained what the consequences are
	of feeding kapchi so early on to infants. Levitt (1993) points out the
	dangers of feeding cereals to newborns who are at risk of asphyxiation
	and diarrhoea. Second, the reason for the early introduction of cereals
	is rooted in the work and economy of the region. This needs to be
	addressed and alternatives worked out with the Layap community rather
	than enforcing a policy simply for policy sake. <br />
	<br />
	It is worrying, however, to find that the baby cereal, Cerelac (Nestle)
	is gradually finding it's way into Laya. First, this is a weaning food
	designed to be introduced after 4 months, once the baby's digestive
	system has matured sufficiently to digest it. Second, the sugar content
	of Cerelac is a lot higher than traditional weaning foods (sugar being
	the third ingredient listed on the packet), thus priming infants for a
	preference for sugary foods. Third, it is often wheat-based, wheat being
	a cereal high in gluten is not recommended for small babies. And fourth,
	it is much more expensive than traditional weaning foods. <br />
	<br />
	<h2>Discussion</h2>
	Bhutan presents an interesting picture of the effects development has
	had on childbirth practice. Health care professionals need to realise
	that there are good and bad practices in the rural areas where
	traditional practice is still the norm. Protagonists of the natural
	birth approach would highlight the beauty of the simplicity of
	childbirth practice in Laya such as the lack of need to intervene, the
	upright position women adopt during labour, and their fitness and
	lifestyle. These could be used to support their argument to return to
	the traditional approach. Although perfectly valid, it is important to
	recognise that Laya does have its own problems. These are namely the
	lack of knowledge concerning the importance of antenatal care, lack of
	hygiene during delivery, care of the cord during the third stage of
	labour and the absence of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 4
	months. <br />
	<br />
	It is important to recognise the good practice and to give credit to the
	women with the knowledge. This could be done by recruiting more women as
	VHWs, and by helping them to develop good childbirth education skills.
	At the same time the practical experience HAs receive in their training
	should include a different approach to delivery, safe handling of a
	physiological third stage and a more participatory approach to
	childbirth education. It is gratifying to know that this deficit in
	skills practice has been recognised and is currently being addressed by
	RIHS as they review and update the curricula of each type of training
	(RIHS 2000). <br />
