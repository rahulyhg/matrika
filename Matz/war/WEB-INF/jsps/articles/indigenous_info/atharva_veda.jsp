	01011, verses 1-6</h3>

	<h2>Charm for easy parturition</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Aryaman as active hotar-priest shall utter for thee the
		vashat-call at this (soma-) pressing, O P청shan! May (this) woman,
		(herself) begotten in the proper way, be delivered, may her joints
		relax, that she shall bring forth!</li>
		<li>Four directions has the heaven, and also four the earth: (from
		these) the gods created the embryo. May they open her, that she shall
		bring forth!</li>
		<li>May S청shan open: her womb do we cause to gape. Do thou, O
		S청shan, loosen the womb, do thou, O Bishkal창, let go (the ernbryo)!</li>
		<li>Attached not at all to the flesh, nor to the fat, not at all
		to the marrow, may the splotched, moist, placenta come down to be eaten
		by a dog! May the placenta fall down!</li>
		<li>I split open thy vagina, thy womb, thy canals; I separate the
		mother and the son, the child along with the placenta. May the placenta
		fall down!</li>
		<li>As flies the wind, as flies the mind, as fly the winged birds,
		so do thou, O embryo, ten months old, fall along with the placenta! May
		the placenta fall down!</li>
	</ol>
