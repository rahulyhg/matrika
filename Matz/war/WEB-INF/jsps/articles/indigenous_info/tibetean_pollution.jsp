<h1>Tibetan and Indian Ideas of Birth Pollution: Similarities and
Contrasts</h1>
<h2>SANTI ROZARIO AND GEOFFREY SAMUEL</h2>
<br />
<br />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This chapter is based on field research carried out with a Tibetan
community in the refugee settlement of Dalhousie in Himachal Pradesh,
North India in June and July 1996. While birthing practices have
obviously been affected by the situation in which this refugee
population is living, we suggest that much of what we found reflects
more general Tibetan attitudes to childbirth and health. We contrast the
approach to childbirth among the Tibetan refugees with that found in
studies of childbirth in North India and Bangladesh, in order to bring
both the Tibetan childbirth practices and the characteristic North
Indian-Bangladeshi approach into clearer focus.<sup>1</sup><br />
<br />
While Rozario’s field research at Dalhousie was specifically on
childbirth, Samuel’s, carried out in conjunction with a third colleague,
Linda Connor, was on a traditional Tibetan medical clinic (see Samuel
1999, 2001; Connor 1996; Connor, Monro and McIntyre 1996). There was
substantial interaction between the research projects, and the present
chapter results from joint reflection on the material by Rozario and
Samuel.<br />
<br />
When we first arrived in Dalhousie, we knew relatively little about
Tibetan ideas regarding childbirth. However, we knew quite a lot about
childbirth in Bangladesh, since Rozario had been doing research on
childbirth in Bangladesh for the previous five years (see Rozario 1995a,
1995b, 1998; this volume, Chapter Six), as well as carrying out a short
study with Maithili people in southern Nepal in 1994. We had also read
enough of the literature on childbirth in South Asian societies to know
that what Rozario had been seeing in Bangladesh and southern Nepal was
part of a widespread pattern in Bangladesh, much of North India and
parts of Nepal.<sup>2</sup><br />
<br />
In the remainder of the Introduction we provide a brief description of
this widespread pattern of childbirth in Bangladesh, North India and
Nepal, and an initial comparison with childbirth among the Tibetan
refugees. Section Two situates these birth practices within the wider
context of pollution concepts and practices in India, Bangladesh and
Nepal. Section Three considers childbirth among the Tibetan refugees and
explores Tibetan pollution concepts. In Section Four, the two regions
and approaches are contrasted. We suggest that while concepts that might
be glossed as “pollution” are significant in both cases, there are
important differences between them, and these differences have
significant consequences for South Asian and Tibetan women.<br />
<br />
As noted in Chapters Four to Six, childbirth in Bangladesh, North India
and much of Nepal, among Muslims and Christians as well as Hindus, is
dominated by what is usually referred to in English by anthropologists
as “pollution”. The most usual form in formal Bengali is <i>oshouch<i>,
which derives from the Sanskrit term <i>aŸauca</i>. Pollution implies
risk of attack by malevolent spirits (usually called <i>bhÒt</i> in
Bangladesh). It also implies the need for separation, since people who
are polluted can transmit their state of pollution to others, placing
them at risk. So people who are in a state of pollution have to be kept
apart from those who are not. This is part of the logic for why men,
including those of the birthing woman’s immediate family, are strictly
excluded from birth in Bangladesh, North India and Southern Nepal. Birth
is very definitely a women’s affair, and men should be kept well clear
of it. <br />
<br />
Most births even today in villages in Bangladesh and elsewhere in the
region take place at home, and are attended by low-caste and low class
traditional birth attendants (usually called <i>dai</i> in Bangladesh
and North India). For a woman to give birth in a public space or with
men present is not only dangerous, it is shameful, and most village
families are unwilling except in extreme emergency to risk the shame of
exposing birthing women to the local hospital with its male medical
personnel. Only a few wealthy families, generally with some exposure to
urban values, would take their women to give birth in a clinic or
hospital.<br />
<br />
Birth therefore takes place at home in the vast majority of cases. Where
possible, particularly among high-caste Hindus, the birth will take
place in a hut outside the house itself though within the compound.
While birth, especially the birth of a male child, is usually a strongly
desired event, the pollution associated with childbirth is a serious
matter, and is sometimes described as being, along with the pollution of
death, the worst of all forms of pollution. The cutting of the umbilical
cord is a matter of particular concern, and it is often left to the
birthing woman herself, since no-one else is prepared to undertake the
pollution and the need for consequent purification (Cameron 1998: 260;
Rozario 1998; cf also Unnithan, Chapter 5).<sup>3</sup> The mother
remains in seclusion for some days after the birth, until a ritual feast
which marks the end of her period of pollution.<br />
<br />
The dai or traditional birth attendants themselves generally come from
an untouchable caste (such as Chamar, leather-worker, or Lohar,
blacksmith) or from other low-status and impoverished groups. They
rarely have any formal medical training. Indeed, it has been argued that
the family of the birthing woman views their function less in terms of
assisting with the birth than of dealing with the associated impurity
and pollution (Jeffrey, Jeffrey and Lyon, Chapter Four, this volume, and
1989). Some recent writers have contested this and stressed that the dai
do have skilled knowledge about childbirth (Chawla 1994 and Chapter
Seven, above; Patel 1994). In Rozario’s own research in Bangladesh, she
found that while many of the dai she met were conscious of their skill
and knowledge, it was often not recognised by the families of the
birthing women, and their opinion was not necessarily listened to (see
this volume, Chapter Six). Generally it seems that older women from the
birthing woman’s family who have some experience of childbirth take
charge of the situation, while leaving most of the physical side of
delivering the child to the dai. This is a pattern also reported by Maya
Unnithan in a recent paper on childbirth in Rajasthan (1999a) and in
Chapter Five of this volume. No doubt the extent to which the dai’s
opinion is asked or her advice taken depends a lot on the personalities
of the individuals involved in any particular case.<br />
<br />
While there have been campaigns to train traditional birth attendants in
North India and Bangladesh, as elsewhere in the Third World, these have
been much less successful than in, for example, South East Asia or
Central America, since the low social status of the dai means that even
if they receive training, their opinions are not necessarily taken
seriously (see Jeffrey, Jeffrey and Lyon, Chapter Four above). In
addition, most dai are elderly and illiterate. Younger, educated women
are very unwilling to do this kind of work. <br />
<br />
All this is a well-known and familiar pattern, repeated in a range of
studies from North India, Bangladesh, and Nepal, including those in the
present volume.<br />
<br />
Studies of Tibetan childbirth, whether in ‘traditional’ or refugee
communities, are much fewer, and much of what is available is normative
and textual rather than ethnographically based. We were thus unsure what
Rozario would find when she began to investigate childbirth among the
Tibetan refugees of Dalhousie. <br />
<br />
At first sight, childbirth among the Tibetan refugees in India seemed to
have many similarities to this pattern. Tibetans too have concepts which
can be described as “pollution,” and they too regard birth as a
dangerous and threatening situation from the supernatural as well as
strictly medical point of view. Possibly, too, the fact that much of
this Tibetan population had been living in India for nearly forty years,
and that Rozario was a South Asian woman who might be expected to have
standard South Asian attitudes, also led people to present childbirth to
her in ways that more closely resembled South Asian patterns. Thus, for
example, while Rozario quite soon came across cases of men, usually
husbands, assisting in childbirth, an almost unthinkable situation in
Bangladesh, these cases were presented to her as not being typical and
as taking place only because no-one else was around to assist. In
addition, the Tibetan births that took place during her fieldwork
occurred in local hospitals, rather than at home, and were handled by
Indian medical personnel, which meant that specifically Tibetan aspects
of the birth situation were perhaps relatively muted. <br />
<br />
Yet the closer we looked, the more it seemed to us that the Tibetan
situation was in fact very different from that we knew from in
Bangladesh, North India, and Nepal. In particular, while the Tibetans
did have a concept that could be translated into English as “pollution”
(the usual Tibetan term is drip) it was really quite different from the
“pollution” we were familiar with in the Bangladeshi, North Indian or
Nepali contexts. To understand the differences, though, we first need to
look in more detail at ideas and practices relating to “pollution” and
childbirth in the North Indian, Bangladeshi and Nepali context. <br />
<br />
<h2>Pollution Concepts and Practices in India, Bangladesh and Nepal
</h2>
The term “pollution” is a very familiar one in the sociology of South
Asian societies, being particularly associated with Louis Dumont’s
classic analysis of Hindu caste society as structured around ideas of
purity and pollution, Homo Hierarchicus (Dumont 1972). For Dumont, Hindu
society is structured around the opposition between purity and
pollution. These form the poles of a linear scale along which castes
(j›ti or j›t) can be arranged as more or less pure, with the Brahmins,
the most pure, at the top end, and the untouchables, the most polluted
or impure, at the bottom. The scale was associated with traditional
occupations, with the Brahmin’s traditional priestly duties linked to
their position at the top of the scale, and work such as sweeping,
cleaning and leather-working being associated with the polluted castes
at the bottom of the hierarchy. It was expressed through restrictions on
marriage and the sharing of food between different castes. <br />
<br />
Dumont held that the caste hierarchy was not merely an ideological
principle. It was also the basis of Hindu caste society as a social
reality. While Non-Hindu societies such as the Muslims of South Asia
might adopt features of caste society, they could not really have a
caste system, because they could not have the central disjunction
between the principle of purity, represented by the Brahmins, and the
principle of political rule. There has been an extensive literature
criticizing and extending Dumont’s work. While there is probably general
agreement that Dumont provides an accurate picture of a dominant mode of
discourse within Hindu society, one particularly associated with the
Brahmans, there is much less agreement about how widely this ideology is
shared throughout Hindu society or how useful it is as a description of
social reality (see e.g. Appadurai 1986; Searle-Chatterjee and Sharma
1994).<br />
<br />
An extended treatment of this literature would be out of place here, but
there are a number of points which are important for our argument:<br />
<ol>
	<li>While the Brahmanical discourse of purity and pollution
	defines an important set of values within Hindu society, this is not
	the only set of values present. In particular, we would agree with
	those authors, such as Triloki Nath Madan (Madan 1987: 48-71),
	Frédérique Apffel-Marglin (1985) and Veena Das (1987) who have
	suggested that a distinct set of values is associated with what has
	come to be called “auspiciousness”. The term “auspiciousness” is used
	by these authors to refer to concerns with everyday life, human and
	agricultural fertility and productivity, health, good fortune and
	success. This whole area has its own set of ritual procedures which are
	not generally carried out by Brahmin priests and which have little to
	do with Brahmanical values.<br />
	<br />
	Childbirth, in particular, may be “polluting,” but it is also generally
	“auspicious” . The degree of penetration of Brahmanical ideology
	throughout Hindu society, particularly among untouchable and other
	low-status groups, is variable and uneven, so there is a real question
	about just how important Brahmanical values were, particularly to those
	non-Brahmin groups who had less invested in the purity principle. We
	will return to this question of the relationship between auspiciousness
	and Brahmanical values at the end of the paper.<br />
	</li>
	<li>Despite Dumont’s assertion that caste and Hinduism are
	indissolubly linked, there have been and still are strong elements of
	caste or caste-like practices among Muslims, Christians, Buddhists,
	Sikhs, Jains and other non-Hindu groups in South Asia. These groups too
	were divided into ranked sub-groups, with higher groups avoiding
	intermarriage with lower groups and behaving in other ways similar to
	high Hindu castes. For Muslims, these high status-groups often
	justified their status in terms of an ideology of descent from the
	Prophet Muhammad, his companions or other immigrant populations from
	the Islamic homelands to the West.<br />
	<br />
	These groups formed part of the same social field as the Hindu castes
	throughout much of South Asia, with villages and wider regions
	typically containing both Hindu and non-Hindu groups (see e.g. Rozario
	1992: 96-98; Bhattacharya 1973).<br />
	</li>
	<li>The relationship between the “pollution” underlying the caste
	hierarchy and the “pollution” associated with childbirth and other
	female biological processes such as menstruation is a complex one.
	There was certainly an overlap between them, in that similar ceremonies
	were prescribed for purifying Brahmins or other high-caste males who
	encountered the two types of pollution. People saw them as similar at
	times. Mary Cameron, for example, tells of a low-caste dai from the
	blacksmith or Lohar caste in Western Nepal joking with the high-caste
	woman whose baby she had delivered by saying “Now you are a Loharni”
	(1998: 261)—meaning that she now shared the polluted status of the
	low-caste dai. But the pollution of childbirth or menstruation is
	temporary, unlike that of the untouchables. Some ideas about pollution
	in the context of childbirth and menstruation seem to occur in most
	parts of Asia, if not throughout the world, so it may be that we need
	to regard pollution ideas as part of a shared body of folk religious
	concepts as much as derivations from Brahmanical ideology. In addition,
	Islam and Christianity have their own ideas of pollution, and the
	several centuries of Muslim rule which preceded the British in the
	region no doubt had some effect on popular conceptions.</li>
</ol>
Despite these various qualifications, it does seem likely that
Brahmanical ideas of pollution have had a very marked effect on the
whole North Indian-Bangladeshi-Nepali pattern we are describing here.
Muslim groups in Bangladesh, North India and Southern Nepal continue to
use traditional low-caste birth attendants, where these are available,
and to regard them with much the same attitudes as those found among
Hindus. This is in large part because they appear to have internalised
the Brahmanical logic according to which pollution has to be removed by
a low-caste specialist, even while not consciously subscribing to other
aspects of caste ideology. Muslim doctors and nurses in Bangladesh, just
like Hindu doctors and nurses in much of North India, are unwilling even
to touch birthing women if they can avoid it, and low-caste and often
untrained nursing aides are usually entrusted with any work which
involves actual physical contact with the patients (see Blanchet 1984;
Leppard 1997; Rozario 1995a).<br />
<br />
The significance of pollution is acted out symbolically in the ritual
practices surrounding childbirth, which are found among Hindus, Muslims
and Christians in North India, and no doubt among other religious groups
as well. These rituals involve the woman’s seclusion during the birth
and for a fixed period afterwards. How long the period lasts varies from
place to place and between religious communities, but there always is a
period of seclusion, which is associated with the danger of attack by
bhÒt and other malevolent forces while the woman is in the polluted
state following childbirth.<br />
<br />
Whatever the number of days and the degree of rigidity, all women
regardless of class and religious background practise confinement and
all perform certain rituals as they leave the delivery room. In the
region of Bangladesh where Rozario carried out most of her fieldwork
(immediately north of Dhaka city) this room is referred to as oshouch
ghor, atur ghor or chodi ghor. Ghor means room, but the three terms used
to specify the room are of interest. We have already referred to
oshouch, meaning “pollution”; atur means sickness and distress. Chodi in
village dialect appears at first sight to be simply another term for
pollution or impurity; Lina Fruzzetti refers to the same term, which she
spells chutti, as being used by the Muslim villagers of Bishnupur in
West Bengal (Fruzzetti 1981). Thus Bangladeshi village women refer to
the rituals that accompany the conclusion of confinement as chodi tula
(“removal of chodi”). These rituals take various forms, but most
households will clean and plaster the mud floor of the hut, wash bedding
and personal clothes, as well as wash the birthing mother.<br />
<br />
However, as Sanjukta Gupta has pointed out, the word has an interesting
and significant derivation, since chodi or chutti in fact derives from
the word for “sixth”—˝a˝˛hı in Sanskrit—which is also the name of the
goddess ¡a˝˛hı who presides over childbirth. ¡a˝˛hı’s rituals, usually
called Cha˛hı in Hindi, form an integral part of the removal of
pollution after childbirth for many Hindu groups in North India. These
rituals may, but are not necessarily, performed on the sixth day after
the birth.<br />
<br />
In 1994, when we did some fieldwork with Maithili families near Janakpur
in southern Nepal, Rozario was able to attend a ¡a˝˛hı ritual which
marked the end of the pollution period for a Hindu Maithili family of
Kayasth caste. This ritual, known as Chhatiyar, involved the mother
making an offering to an image of the goddess Chhati, another version of
¡a˝˛hı’s name, here made out of cow-dung (Samuel 1997: 2-4, Figures 1
and 2). This was followed the next day by further purificatory rituals,
including the washerwoman coming to wash the bedclothes, and the dai
coming to do other cleaning of the confinement room. <br />
<br />
¡a˝˛hı rituals following childbirth have been quite widely reported
(Freed and Freed 1980: 373). She appears to have been a figure of
considerable importance in rural Bengal in the early 19th century, with
a number of village rituals in her honour each year apart from the
offerings made after the birth of a child. In parts of North India
¡a˝˛hı is replaced by a figure called Bem›t› (Freed & Freed 1980:
372-9), Baim›t› (Chawla 1994) or Baham›t› (Minturn and Hitchcock 1966)
who in Hindu mythology was the midwife of the deity Krishna. Bem›t› may
also be worshipped in the form of a cowdung image (Minturn and Hitchcock
1966:103). Both ¡a˝˛hı and Baim›t› may be represented by a painting
rather than a solid image (e.g. Figure 9.1; see also Grierson 1885: 390,
for Maithili people in Bihar; Freed and Freed 1980: 372-373), and again
cowdung seems to be a standard constituent. <br />
<br />
¡a˝˛hı, like Bem›t› has some Sanskritic sanction, figuring as the wife
of the war-god K›rttikeya or Skanda, and being represented alongside him
in some Gupta-period sculptures, but neither ¡a˝˛hı nor Bem›t› in this
village context are really Brahmanical deities. ¡a˝˛hı in particular
seems to have close affinities to the ambivalent goddesses such as
⁄ıtal› and Manas› who are associated with infectious illness, snakebite
and other misfortunes but who are also invoked for protection against
these misfortunes. These goddesses are quite important in the Hindu
villages of North India and there is evidence of them from at least the
6th-7th centuries C.E. onwards. The ambivalence surrounding these
deities is another indication of the complex relationship between folk
religion and Brahmanical values.<br />
<br />
Cow-dung is strongly associated with rituals and practices to do with
“auspiciousness” and good fortune, and its use here for the images and
drawings of ¡a˝˛hı and Bem›t› is not surprising. It is particularly
linked with Lak˝mı, the most important goddess associated with the whole
field of “auspiciousness” and “success”. Lak˝mı’s cult certainly goes
back to the 2nd or 3rd centuries B.C.E., and, while she has again been
incorporated into the Brahmanical pantheon as the wife of the major
deity Vi˝˚u, she too has a complex relationship to Brahmanical values
and in some respects stands quite separate from them (Samuel 1997:
9-12). <br />
<br />
While the Bengali Muslim villagers Rozario knew in Bangladesh did not
appear to know of the connection between chodi and the goddess ¡a˝˛hı,
the West Bengali Muslims with whom Fruzzetti worked did, perhaps because
they were a minority within a Hindu population. While they did not
actually worship ¡a˝˛hı directly, they referred to the day of the
purificatory ritual as ¡a˝˛hır Din, the Day of ¡a˝˛hı. On this occasion
a Koranic verse dedicated to ¡a˝˛hı and known as the Shasthir fatiha is
recited (Fruzzetti 1981: 100-101). <br />
<br />
Closely associated with the ¡a˝˛hı/Bem›t› rituals is the idea that a
deity or spirit comes to write down the child’s future that night. The
Bangladeshi Muslims with whom Rozario worked referred to this night as
haturar rat, and believed that spirits called feresta (“angels”) would
come and write the child’s bh›ggho (future or luck) on its forehead.
These days many families among both Muslims and Christians keep a pen
and an exercise book near the baby or touch the baby’s forehead with
these items, and they also keep a lamp burning all night. This is so
that the baby will obtain a good education and have a good future.
Rozario was told that in the olden days people would touch a baby boy’s
forehead with a plough on this night as a way of enhancing the chances
of the baby boy becoming a good worker in the field. Fruzzetti describes
the Bishnupur Muslims as placing a bamboo pen, ink and paper or leaf in
the corner of the room, keeping an oil lamp burning and waiting “in a
semi-purified state” for the coming of Bidata Purush (Bidh›t› Puru˝a,
God) to write down the child’s fate. Bidata Purush “is the giver of life
whereas Sasthi (referred to as his consort) is the protrectress of
children’s life” (Fruzzetti 1981: 101). Bidata is also frequently
referred to in accounts of childbirth among Bengali Hindus (e.g. Day
1906: 37-8; Dimock 1963).<br />
<br />
Other purificatory rituals may follow at various times after the birth,
and Muslim women, in accordance with Islamic law, are not regarded as
fully purified until forty days after the birth, at which time they may
say their prayers (namaj) and undertake religious fasts, but enough has
perhaps been said to indicate the close connection between pollution,
its cleansing and the rituals for protection and welfare of child and
mother. <br />
<h2>Pollution Concepts and Practices among Tibetans</h2>
“Pollution” is an issue among Tibetans as well, but by North Indian or
Bangladeshi standards, Tibetan notions of birth pollution and the
associated rules appear relatively mild. The term used to refer to
childbirth pollution is kyedrip [skye grib]. Kye means birth, whereas
drip [grib] is a generic term, usually translated as ‘pollution,’
‘defilement’ or ‘contamination,’ and used to refer to numerous other
conditions or situations. Its most basic meaning is perhaps “shadow”.<br />
<br />
<blockquote><i>Drib</i> is the prime cause of misfortune in
everyday life, and has to be remedied by appropriate ritual action to
the gods. In addition, drib makes the individual vulnerable to attack by
malevolent spirits of various kinds. Some degree of drib is almost
unavoidable in everyday life and the attacks of offended deities and of
malevolent spirits have to be ritually combatted on a regular basis.”
(Samuel 1993: 161).<sup>14</sup></blockquote>
<br />
Pilgrimage to sacred Buddhist sites is one of the prime means of
cleansing drip in general. There are long discussions of drip in
Christine Daniels’ doctoral thesis on the pilgrimage site of Bodhnath
(Boudha) in Nepal (Daniels 1994: 27-42) and in Toni Huber’s book on the
major mountain pilgrimage site of Tsari in Southeast Tibet (Huber 1999:
16-18). In an Appendix to her doctoral thesis, Daniels lists twenty-two
named varieties of drip, of which kyedrip is the seventh (Daniels 1994:
286-290). Her discussion however is mainly from the point of view of the
risk the birthing woman and child pose to others:<br />
<blockquote>The custom of abstaining for at least one week
from visiting a place of childbirth was in decline in Boudha. However,
certain persons were warned, for example, those susceptible to birth
pollution or likely to be particularly inconvenienced by illness, such
as students about to take exams or women with much work awaiting them in
the household. To visit in order to help in the household was a virtuous
act but: “They say you shouldn’t handle the baby straight after the
birth because it’s dirty with childbirth and should be taken only by
those helping with the birth. But most people don’t bother to purify
themselves afterwards. The mother and baby are given trü [holy or
consecrated water, a standard purifying substance] and that’s enough”.<sup>15</sup></blockquote>
<br />
Rozario, who had not previously worked with Tibetans, first encountered
the term drip on the second day of her fieldwork in the Tibetan refugee
community of Dalhousie in Northern India. She was talking to Jigme, a
Tibetan woman who was the Community Health Worker and ran a small
dispensary in the main refugee settlement, about whether birth or
birthing substances were perceived as a problem. Jigme commented that
birth and its associated substances were “dirty” (Tibetan tsokpa) and
that they cause sickness, including conjunctivitis and drip. During our
fieldwork in Dalhousie, the term drip came up regularly when people were
discussing their various health problems, not necessarily only to do
with birth.<br />
<br />
Rozario asked our interpreter Jampa, a trained nurse and midwife who was
employed at the School Clinic, about drip associated with birth and
birthing substance. Jampa explained that those who attend and handle
birth are affected by drip. As an example, she said that her grandfather
had delivered all the babies of one of his own daughters (Jampa’s aunt),
as well as cleaning up afterwards. When he has burning or irritation in
his eyes even today, many years later, he says that this is drip,
because he handled all those deliveries. Similarly Tsamcho, a
middle-aged woman who was one of our main informants, told Rozario that
her husband, who had done all the cleaning after her deliveries, had
also been subjected to drip. He had problems with his eyes, and felt
shivery and tired in the evenings. To counter these problems, he used
holy water blessed by the Rinpoch’e, the main Tibetan lama in the
community, to sprinkle over his head, shoulders and wash his face, and
also drank some of it. He also took jinden, consecrated pills and other
substances obtained from lamas which are used generally for purificatory
and protective purposes. <br />
<br />
In order to avoid health problems caused by drip, Rozario was told that
people should not enter the delivery room for three days if it is a boy,
or four days if it is a girl. On the third or fourth day, whichever is
applicable, the birthing woman’s family will do various purification
rituals, after which they can receive visitors. <br />
<br />
In fact protective and purificatory rituals begin immediately after the
birth. In the case of Lendzom, a woman from the settlement who gave
birth at the District Hospital at Chamba, some three hours by bus from
Dalhousie, during our stay in Dalhousie, the rituals began when her
husband Samdup’s mother was allowed into the delivery ward immediately
after the delivery. Samdup’s mother used Tibetan incense (pö, referred
to in Hindi as dhÒp) in which she also burned a little cloth from a
lama. Its smoke was spread around the newborn baby, around its mother,
around an Indian woman who had given birth at the same time, around the
Indian woman’s baby, and around the two nurses who delivered the babies.
After Lendzom was moved back to her own bed (Figure 9.2), Samdup’s
mother repeated the ritual in Lendzom’s ward, taking the dhÒp to all the
women in the ward.<br />
