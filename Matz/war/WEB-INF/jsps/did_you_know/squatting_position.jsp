        Did you know about the use of the squatting position at the time of birth?
    </h2>
    Many midwives and mothers recognize squatting at the time of birth as having many
    advantages.
    <ul>
        <li>Gravity works for, not against as in the lithotomy position where the mother is
            literally pushing the baby UP against gravity, the expulsion of the baby. </li>
        <li>The pelvic outlet is at its widest in the squatting position, allowing the baby’s
            bony structures to move through the mothers pelvic bones, many times avoiding CPD
            or ephalo-pelvic disproportion. </li>
        <li>Women are often supported by attendants offering both physical support and affectionate
            touch, encouraging the mother in her pushing efforts. </li>
    </ul>
    Two public health doctors in India have researched the effectiveness of this method
    of birthing and published their findings in this little book.<br />
