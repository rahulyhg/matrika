    To describe the context within which this book is situated is not an easy task.
    Many scholarly books are introduced with a review of existing writings in the field
    along with relevant history and politics. Birth, however, expands like over-leavened
    bread dough, spilling out of containers, colonising one&#8217;s kitchen with its
    generative force. Babies quicken in mothers&#8217; wombs and mothers in all societies
    experience birth both bodily, and within their socio-cultural context. Birth is
    both imaged and corporeal. Individual women and groups of women make sense of their
    positions within dynamic and fluid environments. It is a challenge to do a review
    of these macro-level, holistic and fluid environments. Complicating the issue, in
    this kitchen &#8216;traditionally&#8217; within the Indian subcontinent, the womb
    and the cooking pot partake of the same meaning as sites of transformation. And
    these cultural signifiers, along with so many others, are images that have been
    transmuted through the hegemonic violence of the colonist&#8217;s language. As Sara
    Suleri writes,
    <br />
    <br />
    To state the case at its most naked, the Indian subcontinent is not merely a geographical
    space upon which colonial rapacities have been enacted, but is furthermore that
    imaginative construction through which rapaciousness can worship its own misdeeds,
    thus making the subcontinent a tropological repository from which colonial and post
    colonial imaginations have drawn&#8212;and continue to draw&#8230;.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>
    <br />
    <br />
    The problem then becomes how to step out of the box in order to name and celebrate
    what I have learned about subcontinental cultural constructions of birth.
    <br />
    <br />
    This collection of essays attempts to recognize, document and amplify voices (and
    silences which enigmatically &#8216;speak&#8217;) that are not usually heard. I
    seek to balance what I consider to be an inordinately dark and shadowy pessimism.
    It does seem that women&#8217;s and feminist scholarly writings on the body within
    India are often more focused on oppression and atrocities than pleasure and celebration;
    on what doesn&#8217;t please them, rather than what does. I have found much that
    awes and delights me, and satisfies my female soul within traditional Indian birth
    cultures. Here I present material which may be useful in skilful reclamation of
    tradition to be brought forward in the contemporary world.
    <br />
    <br />
    Academic and development literature is replete with descriptions and analyses of
    how patriarchy exploits women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive power. International,
    government and NGO initiatives to &#8216;empower&#8217; women and right these gendered
    wrongs abound&#8212;and they are much needed. However precious little exists in
    praise of indigenous gender constructs generally,<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a><sup>
    </sup>or specifically, as they pertain to birth. Entire legacies of female culture,
    which has existed alongside and within patriarchy, are threatened with extinction:
    identities, socialities, knowledges. This book seeks to fill that lacuna by an exploration
    of the world of &#8216;tradition&#8217;&#8212; problematic as that term may be.
    <br />
    <br />
    In this context I shift from the &#8216;reproductive health&#8217; and &#8216;empowerment&#8217;
    jargon of &#8216;women&#8217;s health&#8217; and &#8216;development&#8217; analyses.
    Foregrounding a problematic terrain I ask questions of a past which segues into
    the modern and even postmodern; where syntocin injections used to stimulate labour
    become the ritual of choice, replacing birth rites invoking the goddess Bemata.
    This book explores indigenous Indian (or more precisely South Asian) cultural constructions
    of birth, thus the title <em>Birth and Birthgivers</em>: <em>The Power Behind the Shame</em>.
    After all, childbirth, traditionally, is <em>sharam ki baat</em>, or a matter of
    shame/shyness/embarrassment. It is women&#8217;s business, not men&#8217;s. It is
    an emotional, bloody, life-and-death affair&#8212;to be exposed neither to the male
    gaze, nor public presence, eye or ear; jealousy, <em>chaya</em> and <em>nazar</em>
    lurk threateningly.
    <br />
    <br />
    In this introductory essay I problematize the translation of the word sharam into
    shame. Shame, in English&#8212;according to the <em>New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</em>&#8212;means
    &#8220;the feeling of humiliation or distress arising from the consciousness of
    something dishonourable or ridiculous in one&#8217;s own or another&#8217;s behaviour
    or circumstances, or from a situation offensive to one&#8217;s own or another&#8217;s
    sense of propriety or decency.&#8221; Conversely, shameless means &#8220;lacking
    a sense of shame, devoid of feelings of modesty&#8230;impudent, brazen; suffering
    no shame, free from disgrace, uninhibitedness.&#8221; I propose that<em> sharam</em>,
    read as shame, obscures multivalent and powerful cultural imagings of femaleness.
    Accessing these imagings, as the reader will see below, opens up entire cultural
    worlds&#8212;many of which are sites of women&#8217;s expression, creativity, and
    agency.

    <h3>
        How this Work was Conceived and its Methodology
    </h3>
    Some fifteen years ago I became frustrated with teaching &#8216;natural childbirth&#8217;
    classes to middle and upper class women and couples in Delhi&#8212;preparing them
    for birth without the medical interventions of pharmaceuticals and surgery. Even
    then, too many women ended up having caesareans despite their decision to have a
    normal birth. As an American who had lived and worked in India for many years, I
    had come to know about dais (indigenous midwives) from friends who were women&#8217;s
    health activists and working in NGOs with slum and rural women. Being well versed
    in western notions of natural childbirth, I was very curious about its Indian version.
    I did my first research in collaboration with Action India and Jagori Women&#8217;s
    Documentation Centre when we collected experiences of childbearing from women of
    many classes and communities. Each woman interviewed a woman whom she already knew,
    and, whom she felt would have something meaningful to share about her pregnancy
    and birth experiences. first research in collaboration with Action India and Jagori
    Women&#8217;s Documentation Centre when we collected experiences of childbearing
    from women of many classes and communities. Each woman interviewed a woman whom
    she already knew, and, whom she felt would have something meaningful to share about
    her pregnancy and birth experiences.
    <br />
    <br />
    This was a collective effort, Action India, Jagori and myself as consulting researcher.
    We grounded ourselves with methodologies drawn from psychological counselling techniques
    of active listening and positive reinforcement. Active listening involves an empathetic
    rephrasing of what a woman had spoken, allowing her to go deeper into her own self,
    memories and emotions. This was a turn away from the probing and quantitative orientation
    of the standard &#8216;questionnaire&#8217; methods more commonly used. Positive
    reinforcement meant articulating an appreciation of what the interviewer considered
    to be behaviour which was woman-centred caretaking&#8212;either of herself, of other
    women, girl children, or female infants.
    <br />
    <br />
    We were not dispassionate collectors of data; we were personally engaged with topics
    of menstruation, pregnancy, birth and postpartum. Profoundly dissatisfied with our
    own biomedical encounters, we were willing to use our imaginations and capacity
    for empathy in order to learn from (not &#8216;teach&#8217; and &#8216;uplift&#8217;)
    poor women. By far the most intriguing interviews were those of the<em> basti </em>
    women who still related their experiences in what I have come to call, a religio-cultural
    idiom.
    <br />
    <br />
    Anthropologist, Kalpana Ram, presents the problems feminist scholars face in understanding
    women who ground their experience within a religious identity.<br />
    <blockquote>
        To the extent that feminism itself views the splitting of the self as an index of
        the fundamental crippling of women in patriarchy, and implicitly posits a unified
        and continuous self as the aspiration of a feminist sense of subjecthood, we stand
        the risk which is acute in a country such as India of ceasing to be able to apprehend
        the voices of women who situate their experience within a religious framework.<a
            href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a></blockquote>
    <br />
    And it is precisely this problem which we faced as researchers.
    <br />
    <br />
    In 1995, with the intellectual and practical support of my colleague and friend
    Deepti Priya Mehrotra (who has contributed an essay to this volume, chapter 5),
    I initiated MATRIKA,<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> a broader research initiative
    to further document and analyze birth traditions with a specific focus on <em>dais</em>,
    the indigenous birth specialists of India. Here we were on a slippery slope in terms
    of nomenclature. One reason modern institutions have not been able to incorporate
    or liase with these women in policy and programs is the fluidity of the category.
    As Sarah Pinto unpacks in her sociological essay on birth work and workers in Sitapur
    district of Uttar Pradesh, a division exists in birth work roles between that of
    baby-delivering and that of cord-cutting, cleanup and postpartum care, which is
    always performed by the lowest caste in the areas (chapter 6 in this volume). Pinto
    indicates that it is not only individual religious orientation that acts as a barrier
    to modern understanding of women&#8217;s birth work, but also the complexities of
    caste-based social organization.
    <br />
    <br />
    Nevertheless in the four geographical areas where MATRIKA held a series of workshops
    in collaboration with local NGOs<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> we met women who were
    called dais no matter how loosely they were defined. We interacted with dais who
    had attended thousands of deliveries, and those who had attended only ten. Most
    of our dais did cut the cord, although some didn&#8217;t. We came to realize that
    that act of severing the anatomical bond between mother and child was of utmost
    significance. Our team asked the question &#8220;what does a woman need during pregnancy,
    birth, postpartum?&#8221; At first, in keeping with the code of <em>sharam</em>,
    mentioned above (and perhaps being protective of their trade secrets), they did
    not openly discuss their knowledge and practice&#8212;rather they told us what they
    thought we wanted to hear. They spoke of using clean razor blades to cut the umbilical
    cord, referring women to doctors (even though there were often no facilities or
    doctors in the area), washing their hands, etc.
    <br />
    <br />
    MATRIKA&#8217;s methodology thus involved reversing the common Traditional Birth
    Attendant (TBA) training model by asking groups of dais to &#8216;train us&#8217;
    in their methods. And we persisted in attempting to create the space for their expression,
    as well as our own capacities to hear and understand them. Role playing, ritual
    drawings, singing of birth songs, sharing of birth experiences (ours and theirs)
    as well as dais&#8217; life narratives were our workshop activities. We were able
    to access, and remain with, this different kind of information because we decided
    not to limit ourselves to the modern and mutually exclusive categories of &#8216;medicine&#8217;
    and &#8216;religion&#8217;. Rather we chose to be receptive to diverse ways of facilitating
    birth, diagnosing and healing&#8212;to rituals, deities and demons, <em>bhut-pret </em>
    (ghosts and spirits) and the <em>nazar</em> or evil eye. We attempted to let the
    data which emerged from groups of dais speak the categories, rather than have the
    categories shape the data.
    <br />
    <br />
    NGO health workers provided invaluable assistance to us in the task of deciphering
    meanings, allowing us to deepen our understandings in subsequent workshops. They,
    themselves, were from the local communities and often had longstanding relationships
    with the dais. Health workers, who are not a part of a professional cadre, nor the
    NGO establishment, often have a &#8216;feel&#8217; for the language and life situations
    of traditionally oriented women. When given permission from the higher-ups they
    can be an invaluable human resource in orienting researchers and organizations toward
    a respectful understanding of the &#8216;client&#8217; communities. Unfortunately,
    being keenly aware of the power and attitudes of their superiors, they usually remain
    quiet.
    <br />
    <br />
    During the gestation of the ideas in this work, I was being &#8216;massaged&#8217;,
    so to speak, by Delhi feminists both activists and intellectuals. I would occasionally
    be invited to gatherings at Delhi School of Economics, Department of Sociology or
    Teen Murti Library or Jawahar Lal Nehru University to seminars on some aspect of
    women&#8217;s lives or feminist scholarship. Often I would cringe as so-called experts
    from the west would expound on a topic and the Delhi scholars would politely listen,
    question, and then, slowly, it would emerge that their presentations had been ethnocentric
    and patronizing. The Indian feminist scholars too, who were the cr&#232;me de la
    cr&#232;me of intellectuals, would dazzle with their erudition. Neo-colonialism,
    re-enacted. However when I would try to raise questions of <em>dais</em> and wombs
    and childbirth, I was seen both by western and Indian feminist scholars to be romanticizing
    tradition and/or being an essentialist. There was simply no anthropological/sociological,
    nor even activist slot for my kind of work.<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a> Anthropological
    literature, with the sole exception of Dr. Tulsi Patel at the Sociology Department
    of Delhi School of Economics,<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> has focussed on service
    castes such as <em>dhobins</em>, <em>nains</em>, and their roles as matchmakers
    and ritual participants at the time of births and weddings. But <em>dais</em> and
    cord-cutters, and the caste-based nature of their work do not find their way into
    such scholarly writings. What accounts for this neglect? First and foremost is the
    postcolonial assumption held by the general public and researchers alike that dais
    are not fit subjects for research, being superstitious, ignorant and unhygienic.
    Rather, poor women need to be &#8216;rescued&#8217; from these &#8216;backward&#8217;
    women. Secondly is the fraught nature of &#8216;family&#8217; in independent India.
    &#8216;Family welfare&#8217; for the Government of India has come to mean limiting
    births and not providing quality healthcare. Third is that birth work and workers
    have been &#8216;sharam ki baat.&#8217; A researcher can walk into a village and
    see the dhobin washing clothes, but birth and cord-cutting remain shrouded behind
    the <em>purdah</em>.<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a><sup></sup>
    <br />
    <br />
    Once I submitted a manuscript to a feminist press only to be told (granted, among
    other critiques) that my writing was &#8220;constructing motherhood biologically.&#8221;
    I was disturbed and puzzled, and lacked the intellectual bravado (like a &#8216;good
    woman&#8217;, I was afflicted with &#8216;<em>sharam</em>&#8217;) to persist. But
    went home perplexed (wasn&#8217;t growing a baby in your tummy and pushing it out
    and nursing it, biological?) and continued to follow the direction of my own curiosity.
    <br />
    <br />
    In retrospect, however, I consider it quite ironic that I was accused of &#8216;constructing
    motherhood biologically.&#8217; I have myself been a single mother, a mother in
    a nuclear family, a mother in a joint family. I have been a mother in the United
    States as well as in India. I have three children. With this background I, of all
    people, should be aware of the fact that motherhood is socially constructed! Indian
    feminists too perhaps have somewhat avoided the topic of motherhood. The challenge
    of evolving an Indian feminist perspective on motherhood may be due to the fact
    that being a mother is privileged and valorized, often even compulsory in the Indian
    familial context&#8212;as well as a site for patriarchal and familial oppression
    and exploitation. Experiences such as these led me to a more nuanced reclamation,
    along with a healthy feminist scepticism.
    <br />
    <br />
    Some 15 years ago I was lecturing at Hampshire College in Massachusetts and a scholar
    whom I have since come to respect immensely, Frederique Marglin, began questioning
    me. Frederique, who has worked extensively in/on India, is a trained classical Indian
    dancer and loves India. I watched my own reflexive awareness of a shift of my voice
    in this exhchange, from that of advocate for custom, to that of feminist critic
    of &#8216;tradition&#8217;. I live in India, walk down the street, read the daily
    papers, hear the <em>gup-shup</em> (gossip), continually experience fallout from
    a gender code which enforces male privilege. No, I am not na&#239;vely reclaiming
    the past&#8212;one cannot simply go from oppressive constructions of the &#8220;other&#8221;
    to projecting one&#8217;s hopes, dreams and ideals onto them.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>
    <br />
    <br />
    Also problematic is the fact that woman-as-mother has been valorized at all levels,
    in all traditions via a gendered and seemingly paradoxical metaphysics. The Mother
    Goddess, historically, is a central image in Hindu rite, icon, text and devotion.<sup><a
        href="#11">11</a></sup> Magico-religious properties have always been attributed
    to the body, especially the female body.<em> Nai </em>and <em>dhobin</em> traditionally
    handled hair, fingernails, and clothes carefully, lest they fall into the wrong
    hands and be used to perform black magic. As many papers in this collection attest,
    the placenta is handled with care, postpartum, especially with the boy infant, to
    avoid its misuse by women unable to conceive.
    <br />
    <br />
    Likewise images central to Hinduism (the <em>garbha grihya</em> of temple architecture,
    the <em>hiranya garbha </em>of the Rig Veda, the <em>garbha</em> dancing during
    the Navratra in Gujarat; the sacrality of the pot as transformative vessel (<em>kumha
        mela</em>) all speak obliquely of the awesome aspects of female physiology&#8212;the
    womb and its capacity to hold and transform. This signification code allows for
    human communication in ritual, speech and craft/art but at the same time protects
    the mysteries of the signified (woman-Devi) from a scorching public gaze as surely
    as images in <em>mandirs</em> throughout India are covered with veils, and <em>darshan</em>
    is only given selectively by the pundits. <em>Sharam</em>, in this sense, might
    be the other face of the sacred.
    <br />
    <br />
    The modernist bias of the feminist movement further complicates contemporary discourses
    on gender. In a seminar on &#8220;Masculinities&#8221; held at Delhi School of Economics,
    Delhi University a few years ago, I was struck by the differences between the way
    groups of men spoke of sexuality and the way groups of women did. I was quite unnerved
    as men immediately started talking about semen, wet dreams, and erections&#8212;very
    physical and very visceral&#8212;even showing a film on male fantasy. I thought
    &#8216;hey&#8212;that&#8217;s not fair!&#8217; When women intellectuals talked of
    sex, they spoke of &#8216;the control of female sexuality&#8217; not female desire
    and pleasure, clitoral and vaginal orgasms! When they discussed motherhood, it was
    in terms of exploitation, not what it felt like to have a baby emerge from between
    one&#8217;s legs, or have milk dripping from one&#8217;s breasts. It seemed to me
    the men got to talk about the physicality of it all, without being accused of being
    essentialist.
    <br />
    <br />
    Perhaps this is one reason I love the dais: <em>besharam</em>, embodied and caring
    and spiritual. Interestingly, when I first came to India 26 years ago, I began my
    &#8216;research&#8217; career by interviewing holy women. As we had no such tradition,
    of which I was aware, within my Roman Catholic upbringing, I was curious about this
    phenomenon. And I interviewed Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi, Chidvalasananda (now known
    as <em>Gurumai</em>) and Vimala Thakur&#8212;questioning whether spiritual experience
    was different for men and women. And was there any such thing as &#8216;women&#8217;s
    spirituality&#8217;? This orientation was just emerging in scholarly and popular
    writing in the United States. I learned a bit about <em>kundalini</em>, Kashmiri
    Shaivism and meditation but not much about women. Wise and holy, perhaps, but they
    didn&#8217;t speak to the issues which concerned me as wife, mother, woman: menstruation,
    sex, childbirth, nursing, and being embedded in familial relationships and expectations.
    It took dais to teach me about these aspects of women&#8217;s lives and from a very
    real, embodied &#8216;spiritual&#8217; perspective.
    <br />
    <br />
    When I was na&#239;ve enough to believe that I might find mention of the dai in
    epic or classical texts, I asked the Sanskritist and Marxist historian, Sukumari
    Bhattacharji, for help. She wrote:<br />
    <blockquote>
        The <em>dai</em> is a substitute priest working between two worlds: the sacred and
        the mundane as well as the pre-natal (foetal) and the post-natal. And like the priest,
        or more like the <em>shaman</em>, she discharges her function through control of
        the spirit world. There are demons which seek to delay, prevent or muck up the birth
        (the defective or stillborn babe; childhood diseases; the death of the mother)&#8230;.
        <br />
        <br />
        The <em>dai&#8217;s</em> unique position is equivalent to that of a <em>shamaness</em>;
        she pre-empts, makes interventions in a literal rite of passage. She was allowed
        this privilege, possibly, because the whole process is &#8216;dirty&#8217;. Remember
        the <em>Asvins</em>, divine physicians, were deprived of the<em> soma</em> drink
        in the later Vedic-Epic literature because as physicians they had to touch the uncleanness
        connected with disease. Later Indian literature states that doctors may not be ritual
        guests.
        <br />
        <br />
        The birth rite is the only wholly female rite where male presence is precluded.
        It is solemn, awesome, throbbing with tension because it uniquely empowers the female
        assistant and it is the only rite where a new life enters our world. The <em>dai</em>
        (derived from &#8216;<em>dhatri</em>&#8217;) is symbolic of mother earth; whereas
        the earth gives birth unaided, in a human birth she splits herself into two&#8212;the
        mother and the <em>dai</em>. Note the foetus devouring demons in the Atharva Veda,
        and in the description of Shiva&#8217;s spirit entourage in the <em>Anusasana Parvan</em>
        (Book XIII of the Mahabharata).<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup></blockquote>
    <br />
    The religio-cultural world of traditional birth enchants me precisely because it
    does not fragment the female self into Cartesian dualisms of body/spirit, reason/emotion,
    human beings/gods, religion/medicine&#8212;and even male/female, because, after
    all, both male and female are born from the womb!<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
        &#8216;Birth and Birthgivers&#8217;</h3>
    This book is a forthrightly <em>besharam</em> celebration of indigenous traditions
    relating to birth and their practitioners, birthgivers. Birth is a uniquely female
    capacity. Men do not bear babies in their wombs, nor push them out from between
    their legs, nor feed them from their breasts&#8212;at least not yet. New Reproductive
    Technologies, test tube babies, and cloning may be eclipsing our power, however
    this female biological power still abides. And, perhaps, nowhere in the world has
    it been more extensively celebrated than in the religio-cultural forms of the Indian
    subcontinent.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup>
    <br />
    <br />
    The birth and birthgivers of the title are not hospital births conducted by obstetricians,
    but those which take place in <em>jhuggis</em> and huts attended by dais or other
    traditionally oriented women. Often, we of the modern middle-class, discount these
    practices and practitioners as sites of information relevant to our own health and
    wellbeing. However, I have learned much which could enrich our own body-knowledge.
    Birthgivers are not only the mothers giving their gift of a child to the family
    and community, but they also include the dais or family and neighbourhood women
    who attend them. <em>Dais</em> often refer to their work as &#8216;<em>sewa ka kaam</em>&#8217;
    or work of service. &#8220;God is the doer, the hands are mine&#8221; one Punjabi
    dai said. Yet it is precisely these women, who in popular, historical and medical
    literature, are often accused of being responsible for the deaths of mothers and
    infants. It is these women who catch the babies of the poor women of the subcontinent,
    those who have been excluded from the modernist enterprise of &#8216;development&#8217;.
    And although older, experienced dais speak against the practice, increasingly in
    villages throughout India, the poor are turning to injections rather than rites
    to the goddess to facilitate labour. As D. D. Kosambi noted years ago, women around
    Pune propitiated Sitaladevi, the goddess of childhood diseases, particularly fever
    and pox, after their children were vaccinated. He concluded that to these women
    &#8220;vaccination is just a new-fangled blood-rite.&#8221; <sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup>
    <br />
    <br />
    Birth and birthgivers&#8212;because birth is a site, real and imagined, where life
    meets death, society recreates itself, and, women, as mothers, meet themselves in
    an elemental bodily way. Birth is where women gather together to help a new being
    slither out from between her mother&#8217;s legs, where social constructionism meets
    essentialism. Where women&#8217;s knowledge and creative expression are writ large:
    in songs, stories, rituals, magic and medicine. Birth is where spirits of magnificent
    grandeur lurk, where the neighbors&#8217; or relation&#8217;s<em> nazar </em>can
    fall (evil eye be cast), where songs of sophisticated sociological complexity are
    sung. Where herbs are plucked and boiled and drunk. And the mother&#8217;s body,
    more specifically her nether regions, yoni or birth canal are the <em>bindu</em>,
    the focus and locus of all this activity.<br />

    <h3>
        The Power: Shakti and Satta</h3>
    Deepti Priya Mehrotra points out that the word &#8216;power&#8217; translates into
    Hindi in two senses: <em>satta</em> and <em>shakti</em>.<br />
    <blockquote>
        Whereas &#8216;<em>satta</em>&#8217; looks upon power as a primarily political phenomenon,
        &#8216;<em>shakti</em>&#8217; looks upon power as energy, personal or impersonal.
        The former is used in the context of the state, and of various strata&#8212;racial,
        class, caste, gender. &#8216;<em>Pittrisatta</em>&#8217;, for example, or &#8216;<em>purush-satta</em>&#8217;,
        are the Hindi terms used for &#8216;patriarchy&#8217;; &#8216;<em>raj-satta</em>&#8217;,
        for state power. &#8216;<em>Shakti</em>&#8217;, on the other hand, is used in a
        wide range of cultural contexts to denote the energy or strength that flows through
        all&#8212;through women, men, trees, flowers, goddesses and gods. The entire cosmos
        is connected to &#8216;<em>shakti</em>&#8217; by &#8216;<em>shakti</em>&#8217;.
        &#8216;<em>Satta</em>&#8217; deals with areas of domination and oppression, of one
        group versus another. &#8216;<em>Shakti</em>&#8217;, on the other hand, is a principle
        of movement, growth, action, flowing and flowering.<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup></blockquote>
    <br />
    I consider the distinction Mehrotra has noted between the <em>satta</em> and <em>shakti</em>
    aspects of power germane to the enterprise of this collection of essays. Concepts
    of women&#8217;s &#8216;empowerment&#8217; and &#8216;agency&#8217; are bandied
    about these days like hotcakes (or <em>chappaties</em>?). I have been interacting
    with birthing women, obstetricians, midwives and childbirth educators for over 30
    years in the US and in India. The experienced, older <em>dais</em> whom I have had
    the privilege of interacting with, are the most embodied, empowered, and empowering
    of the lot.<br />
    <br />
    Many urban, English-educated women, will talk in syrupy-sweet and condescending
    voices about how poor, illiterate women must be educated and uplifted. These same
    young women, becoming mothers, will submit willingly to having their bellies sliced
    open and their baby lifted out of its mother-nature given cocoon into the glare
    of hospital lights, the clanging of metallic instruments, antiseptic smells and
    the brusque and unloving hands of strangers. This procedure, caesarean section,
    can be a life-saving intervention. However, when used (mistakenly) to avoid the
    pain of labour; to have the baby on a convenient date and time (for doctor, mother,
    family); to be seen as modern, well-off, or trendy, or, when the labouring woman&#8217;s
    human needs for encouragement, guidance, physical, emotional and spiritual support
    are not met, then caesarean cutting is a horrific mutilation of the female body.
    And, increasingly, globally, this mutilation is becoming the norm.<br />
    <blockquote>
        Disciplinary technologies are not primarily repressive mechanism. In other words,
        they do not operate primarily through violence against or seizure of women&#8217;s
        bodies or bodily processes, but rather by producing new objects and subjects of
        knowledge, by inciting and channelling desires, generating and focusing individual
        and group energies, and establishing bodily norms and techniques for observing,
        monitoring and controlling bodily movements, processes, and capacities. Disciplinary
        technologies control the body through techniques that simultaneously render it more
        useful, more powerful and more docile.<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup>
    </blockquote>
    <br />
    A woman-centred critique of caesareans<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup> and reclamation
    of sharam would be na&#239;ve and grossly misplaced if we were not to acknowledge
    ruptures and discontinuities in any single line of reasoning. This book valorizes
    much of what has taken place behind the veil of purdah, in women&#8217;s special
    spaces, and attempts to document and analyze the &#8216;voices&#8217; raised within
    these texts. But this should in no way be construed as a failure to recognize the
    multiple violations of women, female victimization and enforced silence, which has
    occurred in the name of honour and sharam. Ritu Menon and Kamla Bhasin write of
    the socio-sexual code of sharam as it functioned during partition.<br />
    <blockquote>
        Neither absolute nor monolithic (obviously, not all men agreed that killing kinswomen
        was acceptable) this consensus is, nevertheless, at once deep and wide-ranging and
        encompasses most forms of violence&#8230;. It has two critical and distinguishing
        features: it sanctions the violent &#8220;resolution&#8221; (so to speak) of the
        troublesome question of women&#8217;s sexuality and sexual status&#8212;chaste,
        polluted, impure&#8212;and <em>simultaneously insists on women&#8217;s silence regarding</em>
        it through the attachment of shame and stigma to this very profound violation of
        self. Thus, the woman raped, the woman who may be raped, the raped child, the young
        widow whose sexuality can no longer be channelised, the wife raped by kinsmen or
        others, the women who must be killed so that their sexuality is not misappropriated,
        the wives, daughters and sisters who must be recovered so that sexual transgression
        is reversed&#8212;are all compelled into acquiescing.<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup>
    </blockquote>
    <br />
    <h3>
        <em>Sharam</em>&#8212;A Peek Behind the Purdah</h3>
    <em>Sharam</em> as shame needs to be deconstructed and viewed from within, not dismissed
    with the simplistic and judgemental assertion such as the below, found in a popular
    work on birth in India.
    <br />
    <blockquote>
        Women are still ashamed of their sexuality, and regard themselves as polluting to
        others when they menstruate or give birth. Common shame is a poor basis for common
        action.<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup></blockquote>
    <br />
    <em>Sharam</em> is usually translated as shame, but the meaning of the word is much
    more complex and nuanced. Implicit in the modernist tendency to accept sharam (the
    word and the concept) as connoting shame, in its uniformly pejorative sense, is
    a radical distortion of female cultural domains.
    <br />
    <blockquote>
        One of the main features of imperial oppression is control over language&#8230;Language
        becomes the medium through which a hierarchical structure of power is perpetuated
        and the medium through which conceptions of &#8216;truth&#8217;, &#8216;order&#8217;,
        and &#8216;reality&#8217; become established. Such power is rejected in the emergence
        of an effective post-colonial voice.<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup><br />
        <br />
        <em>Sharam</em> can be viewed as an agreed upon social code which offers both protection
        and the ability to negotiate within a gendered world as well as delimiting female
        behaviour and domains. By only focusing on the negative aspects of this code we
        neglect the<em> shaktic</em> aspect of female physiological processes. I use &#8216;<em>shaktic</em>&#8217;
        here to refer to the cultural entwining of the sexual/menstrual/birthing energies
        of the female body and the heterodox Hindu streams which valorize woman as embodiment
        of the divine and understand her female physiological processes as signs of divine
        manifestation.</blockquote>
    Actually, shame is a mistranslation, or terribly incomplete one, for the Hindustani
    word of Urdu origin, &#8216;<em>sharam</em>.&#8217; Menstruation and childbirth
    on the subcontinent have traditionally been matters of &#8216;<em>shame</em>&#8217;
    or &#8216;<em>sharam ki baat</em>.&#8217; In our MATRIKA workshops researching birth
    with groups of slum and rural dais, we enforced a &#8216;women-only&#8217; exclusionist
    policy because of <em>sharam</em>. Traditionally oriented women will not discuss
    these matters when men are present. If we had admitted men, no matter how gender-sensitive
    they were, the dais would have remained proper and tight-lipped. Their culturally
    appropriate behaviour norms dictated that these were female-body centred matters
    which had no place &#8216;in the male gaze.&#8217; How could we investigate the
    handling of pregnancy, birth and postpartum if we violated one of the basic tenets
    of indigenous cultural discourse?
    <br />
    <br />
    Conversely in a national meeting on women&#8217;s health &#8220;Many Voices: One
    Agenda,&#8221; one NGO presented on their work with adolescent women. The speaker
    related their work on menstrual hygiene saying that they encouraged young women
    to hang their menstrual cloths out in the sun to dry them, rather than tucking them
    under the mattress as they sometimes did. She went on to narrate, very indignantly,
    that one (obviously considered ignorant) mother actually &#8220;beat&#8221; her
    daughter for putting her washed menstrual cloth outside. No one, except me, spoke
    up against an intervention by the NGO which led to such a vehement reaction from
    a mother, obviously based on an understanding of the significance of menstrual blood
    which differed radically from that of the NGO. After the meeting several people
    came up to me (observing the rules of <em>sharam</em>&#8212;not speaking out honestly
    in the face of authority figures) and shared privately that they were happy that
    someone had spoken out. Modernist and simplistic NGO and medical programs continually
    function in total ignorance of the complexities of indigenous body culture. The
    challenge before us is to create a balance between modern health knowledge and facilities
    and that of indigenous health practices and practitioners, such as <em>dais</em>,
    Ayurvedic practitioners and ritual healers.<br />
    <br />
    Such mistranslations, oversimplifications and ignorance of the very existence of
    other systems of body knowledge, by scholars as well as NGOs, manufacture an unmitigatedly
    bleak picture of the birth scenario in India.<br />
    <br />
    Alongside the <em>jachcha&#8217;s</em> weakness, vulnerability and capacity to contaminate
    others is another aspect of maternity: <em>sharam</em>. The<em> jachcha&#8217;s</em>
    condition is a <em>sharam-ki-baat;</em> her physiological processes are embarrassing,
    distasteful and striking evidence of her sexuality.<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup><br />
    <br />
    In much of the current public health, maternal-child health and &#8216;reproductive
    health&#8217; literature and interventions, the indigenous culture of childbirth
    is not only filthy but also oppressive and victimizing of women. This stream of
    thought has a long and hoary past. (<em>Mother India</em> by Katherine Mayo, The
    Countess of Dufferin&#8217;s Fund,<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup> etc.) Edward W.
    Said&#8217;s critiques of colonialism foreground the cultural imperialism pervading
    current attitudes towards indigenous birth practices and practitioners.
    <blockquote>
        &#8230;But we must also focus on the intellectual and cultural argument within the
        nationalist resistance that once independence was gained, new and imaginative re-conceptions
        of society and culture were required in order to avoid the old orthodoxies and injustices&#8230;The
        women&#8217;s movement is central here.&#8221; <sup><a href="#24">24 </a></sup>
    </blockquote>
    Much feminist writing has considered the female body as a political battleground,<sup><a
        href="#25">25</a></sup> from the colonizers to the nationalists, from the government
    to the <em>Hindutva</em> brigade.
    <br />
    <br />
    Even fictional versions of &#8216;new and imaginative re-conceptions&#8217; rework
    of this cultural idiom of shame. Salman Rushdie wrote a novel entitled <em>Shame</em>&#8212;and
    the book shows a keen sensitivity to female cultural forms. In Midnight&#8217;s
    Children, his first novel, he analogises the writing of the novel with the making
    of <em>achar</em>&#8212;a quite positive rendering of women&#8217;s domestic activity.
    However, in <em>Shame</em>, we find another cultural trope, the collective mothers,
    depicted in the register of the grotesque, the horrific. Collective mothers (sometimes
    called <em>Saptamatrika</em>) are to be found in the Rig Veda, voluptuous sculptural
    renderings, literary and ritualistic manifestation. Referred to as Mother Goddesses
    or <em>Shaktis</em>, they link Brahmanical with non-Brahmanical traditions. Rushdie,
    however, fictionalises these female activities (sex and baby-making and childrearing)
    subverting the fecundity of maternal enterprise in service of polemics.
    <br />
    <br />
    Similarly, avoiding the complex and fantastical world of Rushdie, Taslima Nasrin
    titled her political document <em>Lajja</em>. A word which carries much the same
    meaning as <em>sharam</em>, here it seems to be used for its cultural currency&#8212;and
    yet in a totally unequivocal sense&#8212;that of the shame/guilt of those responsible
    for the mindless bloodthirstiness of fundamentalism.<em> Lajja</em> novelised the
    horrors that took place in Bangladesh after the destruction of Babri-Masjid and
    showed the vulnerability of women to all manner of exploitation. Towards the end
    of the novel even Suranjan, the activist Hindu protagonist, resorts to the rape
    of a Muslim prostitute in his anguish over his sister&#8217;s abduction and his
    imaginings of the sexual violence she is experiencing. The novel graphically dramatizes
    the violent intersection of gender and religion.
    <br />
    <br />
    On the other hand, in her work, Reading Lolita in <em>Tehran</em>, Azar Nafisi writes
    of the aesthetics of the veil and its absence in those who don it for political
    reasons.
    <blockquote>
        There is something peculiar about the way they wear their chadors&#8230; For there
        is, in them, in their gestures and movements, none of the shy withdrawal of my grandmother,
        whose every gesture begged and commanded the beholder to ignore her, to bypass her
        and leave her alone. All through my childhood and early youth, my grandmother&#8217;s
        chador had a special meaning to me. It was a shelter, a world apart from the rest
        of the world. I remember the way she wrapped her chador around her body and the
        way she walked around her yard when the pomegranates were in bloom. Now the chador
        was forever marred by the political significance it had gained. It had become cold
        and menacing, worn by women like Miss Hatef and Miss Ruhi with defiance. (p. 192)<sup><a
            href="#26">26</a></sup></blockquote>
    What is this femininity, this female bodily presence that simultaneously begs and
    commands, that is cloaked by the veil? Keep in mind that these descriptions are
    written by a woman who was fired because she refused to wear the chador to the Tehran
    University.
    <blockquote>
        There are different forms of seduction, and the kind I have witnessed in Persian
        dancers is so unique, such a mixture of subtlety and brazenness, I cannot find a
        Western equivalent to compare it to. I have seen women of vastly different backgrounds
        take on that same expression: a hazy, lazy, flirtatious look in their eyes. I found
        Sanaz&#8217;s look&#8230;as she suddenly began to dance to music with stretches
        of naz and eshveh and kereshmeh, all words whose substitutes in English&#8212;coquettishness,
        teasing, flirtatiousness&#8212;seem just not poor but irrelevant.<sup><a href="#27">27
        </a></sup>
        <br />
        <br />
        Within the Indian subcontinent gender-culture relationships are also formatted by
        these kinds of cultural nuances. In the Nava Rasa system, the elaboration of emotional
        states underpinning classical Indian aesthetics, <em>sharam</em> is subsumed under
        the category of <em>shringar</em>, the erotic. A complex palette of possibilities
        are involved. Displaying coyness (knowing and aware), shyness (of a very young girl,
        at the beginning of a <em>padam</em>) or embarrassment (if her <em>pallu</em> falls
        off or buttons come undone).<sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup></blockquote>
    Similarly the ethnographic fieldwork of Raheja and Gold, in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan,
    alert us to the fact that &#8220;the gestures constituting purdah, or female seclusion,
    were recognized as poses, enforced by behavioural codes&#8230;They did not appear
    in the least to be fundamentally ashamed of female bodily processes.&#8221;&nbsp;<sup><a
        href="#29"> 29</a></sup> And one of the major arguments of their book is that
    &#8220;the performances associated with Hindu festivals and the many rituals surrounding
    birth, children, and weddings are both expressions of and sources for women&#8217;s
    positive self-images.&#8221;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#30">30</a> </sup>Raheja and Gold&#8217;s
    work stepped out of the box and presented ample data to question the cultural image
    portrayed in some academic work of Hindu women as, &#8220;ambivalently construed
    and inherently split&#8221; having internalised patriarchal norms. According to
    Raheja and Gold, Sudhir Kakar, psychoanalyst; Wendy Donniger O&#8217;Flaherty, Sanskritist
    and historian of religion; and Lynn Bennett, anthropologist, all assert profound
    disjunctions between sexuality and fertility. They claim that the &#8220;split-image
    approach to South Asian women derives largely from the male point of view&#8221;
    and point out that none of these authors claim to give women&#8217;s view of women.
    Their own documentation of women&#8217;s songs displayed maternal-erotic holisms
    beyond the scope of Cosmopolitan magazine or the Kama Sutra. Indeed, we have much
    to learn from the songs of our rural sisters.<br />
    <h3>
        Problem of Voice: Representation and Re-presentation</h3>
    We face a particularly acute problem of re-presentation in the domain of &#8216;religion&#8217;
    and ritual. For ten years or so the American academe has been prolific in generating
    research on the goddesses of India, folk religion, and women&#8217;s ritual practice&#8212;in
    history of religion, anthropology and women&#8217;s studies disciplines. It is my
    impression that academic research and publications tend to generate a biased view
    of what constitutes women&#8217;s spirituality. The insiders, who know the context,
    because they live, work and grew up here write either analytical, polemical or devotional
    tracts, and the outsiders, grounded in theory and &#8216;literature in the field&#8217;,
    come and do dissertation research for a few years, contributing further to that
    literature, but little to ongoing Indian or &#8216;development&#8217; discourses.<br />
    <br />
    In considering scholarly writing on childbirth, I have encountered this situation
    with two authors: Rajeshwari Sunder Rajan and Cecilia Von Hollen. Sunder Rajan discusses
    the pain of childbirth, and the &#8216;naturalization&#8217; of female pain in her
    essay on sati. She makes the point that &#8220;An initial dichotomy of body and
    spirit is the basis for postulating the superiority of spirit over flesh, as in
    all forms of asceticism, heroism and marytyrdom. The subjectification of the sati
    demands, not a devalued &#8216;body for burning&#8217;, but a body invested with
    exceptional physical properties.&#8221;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup><br />
    <br />
    All of our MATRIKA data supports this assertion of the female body as invested with
    exceptional properties. Anuradha Singh in her essay on Ayurveda states that the
    female body is viewed as a microcosmic workplace, the site of creation and regeneration&#8212;where
    macrocosmic forces are transacted in microcosmic bodily form. Problems arise when
    we examine that notion of the valorized female body without factoring in women&#8217;s
    own (behind the <em>purdah</em>, <em>sharam ki baat</em>) cultural constructions
    of the body. It also seems important to note that patriarchal and patrilineal constructions
    of the female body, whether they valorize or disparage the female physical form,
    do so in the service of husbanding, or controlling, both women&#8217;s sexuality
    and the paternity of her children.
    <br />
    <br />
    Sunder Rajan, in examining the explanations that &#8216;the sati does not feel pain
    as you or I do&#8217; argues that,
    <blockquote>
        Ritual pain is regarded as a discipline, a yogic submission, both abject and heroic&#8230;Such
        attribution of separateness is facilitated also by the absolute otherness of woman
        as subject-of-pain through the mystique built around sexual difference. The labour
        of childbirth, for instance, is frequently treated as both natural for women and
        selflessly, even heroically, submitted to; since men can have no experience of it
        they are willing either to valorize women&#8217;s experience through mystification
        or naturalize it through acceptance of anatomical difference.<sup><a href="#32">32</a></sup></blockquote>
    Von Hollen likewise invokes the<em> tapasya</em> of the dominant tradition in her
    explication of women&#8217;s discussions about the pain of childbirth. &#8220;A
    key concept which arose in discussions about the relationship between suffering
    and <em>shakti</em> in the context of labour pains was that of <em>tapas</em>&#8230;.In
    short, tapas is the bodily experience of internal heat from self-inflicted suffering
    as well as the power derived from that heat.&#8221;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#33">33</a></sup>
    Many legends and rituals depict the heat of the earth, or that of the sages who
    have been practicing austerities&#8212;and the interventions, ritual or mythic&#8212;which
    are needed to correct the situation. But the heating of the body has other significance
    besides self-inflicted suffering and valorized women&#8212;that of the heat of generating
    new life. It is important to note here that we have abundant textual and other data
    on the phenomenon of <em>tapasya</em>, but sacred texts, orthodox Hindu myth and
    knowledge of yoga and other ascetic practice are androcentric source material.<br />
    <br />
    Von Hollen makes the important observation that women whom she interacted with in
    Tamil Nadu do not turn away from the pain and want painkillers (the way westerners
    do) but rather choose oxytocics which intensify the pain and supposedly get the
    baby born. &#8220;<em>Piracava vali </em>and<em> iduppu vali </em>refer to both
    the sensory experience of pain and the function which the pain serves&#8212;the
    contractions.&#8221;<br />
    <br />
    MATRIKA research findings reflected similar attitudes about the pain of contractions&#8212;but
    their idiomatic expressions were more like &#8220;the pot is boiling&#8221; and
    heating substances were given to increase the heat in the body. This, I would argue,
    is in a very different register than that of <em>tapasya</em>&#8212;and is totally
    congruent with an ethno-medical understanding leading to practical therapeutics.
    Suffering is not chosen for purification of body or spirit, but rather as an acceptance
    of physical difficulties encountered in bringing new life into the world. This is
    an essential paradigmatic shift which might reframe the masculine, ascetic spirituality
    as mimetic of female biological processes. Heating in the female body is, pardon
    me, &#8216;natural&#8217; during menses and birth. Bodily experience involving transformation
    in the service of bearing new life. Men have to simulate it in tapasya.<sup><a href="#34">34

    Vidya Rao, in her essay (chapter 2) &#8220;Singing the Female Body: An Exploration
    of Sohar Songs&#8221; examines women&#8217;s expressions of experience of pain not
    from the perspective of the valorized ascetic of the dominant traditions (the practice
    of <em>tapasya</em>), nor even that of the <em>viraha </em>(the woman longing for
    her lover), but that of the female householder, whose pain is that of childbirth.
    <blockquote>
        These songs speak of pain, raw, earthy, real pain, pain not in the heart, but in
        back and legs, and stomach. Pain and discomfort, not heartache makes the<em> jachcha</em>
        unable to eat. Her face is pale not from love and longing, but from nausea!
    </blockquote>
    And within the context of sohar, directions are given as to how this pain can be
    assuaged. And not by the <em>saas</em>,<em> nanad</em> or<em> jethani</em>, but
    rather her own mother, or the dai&#8212;but above all the tender ministrations of
    her own husband, he who has put her in this very uncomfortable situation.<br />
    <br />
    Rao accesses the fluidity of imagistic renderings of the female body, through varied
    aesthetic traditions which are often understood as discrete: thumri, sohar, Therighata,
    bhakti, Natyashastra, Kalidas.* As a singer-scholar she guides us through worlds
    of courtesans, textual traditions, folklore, nuns and <em>besharam</em> female saints&#8212;giving
    us a helpful context for apprehending the sohar tradition.<br />
    <br />
    As I was writing this introduction I heard art historian Vikas Harish narrate the
    following folk tale during a walk through the National Museum&#8217;s miniature
    painting gallery. A king wanted to learn how to sculpt so that he could make a sculpture
    of himself. He approached a sculptor to teach him. The sculptor said that he would
    teach him, but first he would have to go to a painter, and learn how to draw and
    paint the human form before learning three dimensional renderings. The painter also
    agreed to teach the king, but said that first he must go to a dancer, to learn about
    movement, before learning to depict the human body as static. The dancer also agreed,
    but said that sound preceded movement, and the king must learn music before learning
    to dance.<sup><a href="#35">35</a></sup><br />
    <br />
    Similarly Rao details the ways in which women within different situations, and differently
    situated within those situations (jachcha, saas, nanad are differently situated
    at different times in their lives) apparently have found freedom within informally
    codified forms manage to say what they have to say. As Rao points out
    <blockquote>
        When any text (and this includes a song) allows space, or when the performers create
        space, for multiple voices and perspectives to be heard within the performance and
        the text, this succeeds in disturbing the tendency to stereotype and essentialize
        both characters and actors.</blockquote>
    Just as the aesthetic experience segues into a thick braid of representational forms,
    so too does sohar produce a seamless web of traditionally-oriented women&#8217;s
    experiences of familial relations, sexuality, maternity. Rao presents us with silences
    too, childlessness, the refusals of pregnancy, poverty. Singers are listeners and
    listeners are singers and the<em> jachcha</em>, whom all the fuss is being made
    about&#8212;does not sing! Finally sohars articulate women&#8217;s abilities to
    see bodies (the pregnant &#8211; two hearted one), persons and relationships not
    in a stand-alone ascetic mode, but as inclusive, of the &#8216;other/s&#8217;.<br />
    <br />
    In Manju Kapur&#8217;s &#8220;Birth of a Baby&#8221; (chapter 3) we shift from hearing
    the collective and &#8216;traditional&#8217; voice to that of the individual and
    the &#8216;modern&#8217; (or is it postmodern?) woman writing personally of her
    own birth experiences. I have taught childbirth classes and am familiar with this
    voice from the American &#8216;natural childbirth&#8217; genre of writing. But to
    my knowledge there is no Indian version of this forthright individual voice&#8212;except
    for perhaps tidbits in novels.
    <br />
    <br />
    The contemporary interest in &#8220;natural childbirth&#8221; originated with the
    1933 publication of <em>Natural Childbirth </em>(later called <em>Childbirth without
        Fear</em>) by an English obstetrician, Dr. Grantly Dick-Read. This was followed
    in the 1950&#8217;s by the work of Dr. Ferdinand Lamaze, a French physician. One
    could write a book on the history of natural childbirth, but two points are important
    here. First, there was nothing indigenous or traditional about it. Secondly, insofar
    as it was popular, it was a reaction to the over-medicalization of birth, and women&#8217;s
    profound dissatisfactions with their birth experiences. As Manju herself relates,
    her home birth was not grounded in tradition, but in her own &#8220;being individual,
    modern and doing my own thing.&#8221; The <em>dai</em>, hired to clean up the mess
    and wash the clothes, was present almost by accident because the doctor didn&#8217;t
    make it.
    <br />
    <br />
    Choosing to have her fourth child at home horrified her family and at first she
    was plagued by doubts. Was she creating trouble? Being self-indulgent? A novelist
    who has probed family relationships in her previous works (<em>Difficult Daughters </em>
    and <em>A Married Woman</em>) Kapur is frankly physical (<em>besharam</em>) in her
    descriptions of birth both at home and hospital. Her delightful piece displays her
    ironic sense of humour. She is able to analyse and critique.
    <blockquote>
        I had always been told that episiotomies were necessary to prevent untidy vaginal
        tearing, that a neat precise cut was preferable to nasty jagged edges. Now I was
        torn and not cut. The area had been cut and stitched three times before and was
        no longer supple, so a tearing was inevitable. I had the jagged tear I had been
        so protected against in all my previous deliveries.
        <br />
        <br />
        And what a difference! How easy it was this time! I had no stitches poking, no bristle
        digging into me. No soreness while walking&#8230;The doctor&#8217;s advice was do
        not strain yourself&#8230;the area is so elastic it will heal itself. And it did!
        Then why, why had I been made to endure all that torture before? The shaving, the
        cutting, the stitching?
    </blockquote>
    This essential physiological truth, related by Kapur, should make every woman of
    childbearing age take note and investigate further. She describes the biomedical
    rationale behind the episiotomy, that a tear is worse than a cut, but there is ample
    evidence to indicate otherwise.<sup><a href="#36">36</a></sup> In India obstetricians
    routinely perform an episiotomy on first-time mothers. (Some of MATRIKA&#8217;s
    slum women informants called episiotomy a &#8220;chhota [small] operation&#8221;&#8212;whereas
    a caesarean was a &#8220;burra [big] operation.&#8221;) Gradually, in the United
    States, this routine obstetrical practice is changing. Midwives are usually trained,
    either in their formal studies, or informal apprenticeships, to massage the perineum
    (the area between

    His words reach me across a vast chasm. Is there a world where people think of doctors
    and make decisions about their bodies? If there is, I am not part of it. I am a
    mass of turmoil that involves every cell of my body.vagina and rectum), allowing
    it to slowly move out of the baby&#8217;s path. An obstetrical curriculum details
    the use of the scalpel, but not massage. Episiotomy can be a life-saving intervention
    when used judiciously. As a routine procedure for first time mothers it is nothing
    short of ritual genital mutilation.<br />
    <br />
    Kapur is skilful in giving voice to the body-self:
    <blockquote>
        His words reach me across a vast chasm. Is there a world where people think of doctors
        and make decisions about their bodies? If there is, I am not part of it. I am a
        mass of turmoil that involves every cell of my body.</blockquote>
    She resists the voice of authority, and describes bodily sensations:
    <blockquote>
        The door bursts open. Enter, the doctor, a nurse and the family. First thing the
        doctor says is &#8220;Lie down.&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; I respond. My body is still
        in charge of my position.<br />
        A few minutes later another warm wet feeling and the placenta emerges. Vaguely I
        realise, oh that&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t lie down, there was still the placenta
        to deliver.
    </blockquote>
    And then, the accidental dai. Arranged by her traditionally oriented mother-in-law
    to bury the placenta and wash the bloody clothes, she is called in at the last minute
    because the doctor has said that the baby will be born in the morning and has gone
    home! Her household is ritualistic: observing the laws of sootak, burial of the
    placenta under the mango tree, being ritually attired in red saris for puja and
    naming ceremony&#8212;and the crowning glory, carrying cow dung on her head to be
    deposited in the well!
    <h3>
        Problem of Knowing&#8212;How do we Know the Body?</h3>
    Lal Ded was a Kashmiri mystic of the 14th Century claimed by Hindus and Muslims
    alike. One story relates that she came to call on her guru, Shrikantha, only to
    be told that he had undertaken <em>chandravana</em>, a forty-day, austere, &#8220;moon&#8221;
    penance of fasting and self-mortification and that he was occupied with his meditation.
    Lalla, as she was called, observed that he was actually thinking of his horse in
    the high meadows. Shrikantha overheard this remark and emerged from his supposed
    meditation&#8212;because that was exactly what he was thinking about.
    <blockquote>
        Then it is said, she gave him a demonstration of what the penance should really
        be. She placed an earthen pot on her head and another under her feet; and with the
        waning of the moon; her body waned till, on the fifteenth night of the dark fortnight
        (Amavasya), nothing was left of her except a little quantity of trembling quicksilver.
        Then, with the waxing moon her body waxed and, on the full moon night, she was herself
        again.<sup><a href="#37">37</a></sup></blockquote>
    Following Jungian and anthropological interpretive methodologies (but also congruent
    with <em>tantric</em> and <em>shaktic</em> ritual and practice), I read this narrative
    as referring to women&#8217;s menstrual rhythms. Lal Ded, in her<em> vaakh</em>,
    (Kashmiri sayings and songs) displays to her male mentor that a female does not
    need to practice austerities in the same manner as a male adept. He observes lunar
    rhythms by fasting and mortifications&#8212;she by directing her consciousness,
    to her self-body connection with cosmic forces, those moving through her monthly
    (lunar) rhythms. <em>Here there is no self/body split. There is no self/cosmos split.
        So a female self does not need to practice austerities, but rather centre on and
        move with cosmic embodied forces</em>. A spiritual praxis of embodied gnosis.
    <br />
    <br />
    As Sunder Rajan acknowledges, &#8220;&#8230;the body/mind dichotomy is so firmly
    in place in theoretical discourse, religious as well as philosophical, that any
    invocation of the body as ground for human subjectivity inevitably appears reductive.&#8221;
    Lal Ded&#8217;s <em>Vaakh</em> is not, I would argue, reductive, it simply speaks
    another language, that of an aesthetic, an imagistic, knowing, where knower and
    known are not wrenched into orthodox dualisms of body/spirit, man/god, profane/sacred.
    <br />
    <br />
    Another split is avoided here also, that of the valorization of woman-as-mother.
    I suggest that female physiology in many heterodox religious traditions signifies
    in the realm of energy and potential. Potential for motherhood, yes. Menstruation
    denotes that. But with Lal Ded, and other <em>besharam </em>women, Mira Bai, Akkamahadevi,
    who wander about sometimes naked, defying conventional gender norms, it is hardly
    motherhood (or even the potential for it) which is being depicted, rather, it is
    the female capacity for ecstatic and embodied enlightenment. So we should not be
    surprised to find other modes of female-gendered knowing in the domain of childbirth.
    <br />
    <br />
    Often traditional birth knowledge and practice is understood to be &#8216;superstitious&#8217;
    or outdated. But perhaps they are dismissed because, as Foucault noted, they are
    subjugated knowledges. No one can package and peddle them, thus, they are ignored.
    <blockquote>
        I believe that by subjugated knowledges one should understand &#8230;.a whole set
        of knowledges that have been disqualified as inadequate to their task or insufficiently
        elaborated: na&#239;ve knowledges, located low down on the hierarchy, beneath the
        required level of cognition or scientificity<sup></sup>.<sup><a href="#38">38</a></sup></blockquote>
    In India we are fortunate to possess a conceptual tool, Ayurveda, which is congruent
    with the &#8216;scientificity&#8217; of the dais and traditional birth practices.
    Anuradha Singh states in her essay on Ayurveda and maternity that the strong theoretical
    base provides a conceptual rationale and explanatory framework for specific practices
    which folk, local and oral traditions lack. Unfortunately the practice and teaching
    of Ayurvedic medicine today is commonly mixed with allopathic medicine in India,
    and institutions supposedly dedicated to propagating indigenous and Ayurvedic medicine
    are rife with internal political struggles.<sup><a href="#39">39</a></sup>
    <br />
    <br />
    Anuradha Singh, the author writing on Ayurveda and motherhood, (chapter 4) was a
    consultant with MATRIKA during our research on dais. I would have long telephone
    conversations with her. &#8220;Look Anuradha, they are saying that after the birth
    the mother will suffer from<em> hawa-gola</em>. How can it be both <em>hawa</em>
    (wind) and <em>gola</em> (ball)? What are they talking about? Gas?&#8221; And in
    conversing I would learn that, in dais&#8217; parlance about the postpartum time,
    the <em>gola</em>&#8212;the roundness of the now-empty womb, the space vacated by
    the baby, now may be filled by the air element&#8212;and must be dealt with, in
    order to avoid that danger, by giving her warm food and drink, by massage, by rituals.<sup><a
        href="#40">40</a></sup> During our <em>Dai Mela</em> we learned about a postpartum
    ritual involving breaking a coconut, and the understanding was that it was not the
    coconut itself which was being broken&#8212;it was the space inside the coconut
    that was being broken. In the civilization in which the concept of zero originated;
    where Buddhist shunyata signifies the source of the phenomenal world; where Brahmistan,
    the center space of a building, should be left vacant, we should not be surprised
    by the active postpartum management of the empty womb. Anuradha would understand
    the<em> dais</em>&#8217; word pictures in ways that MATRIKA researchers didn&#8217;t&#8212;and
    this interactive process was crucial to our ability to deepen our understandings
    of the dais&#8217; language and practice.
    <br />
    <br />
    In her paper Anuradha states that in her NGO interactions with local practitioners
    &#8220;It was as if the classical language of the medical texts had come alive in
    the narratives of these practitioners.&#8221; She sees similar underlying principles
    at work but at two different levels of discourse and presents the example of the
    textual treatment of bodily existence at three levels: the gross, the subtle and
    the causal or <em>karmic</em>. She comments that dais seem to traverse the same
    paths of the known; the knowable; and the unknown, simultaneously using their capacities
    for intuition and imagination, as well as inference and logical thinking. I remembered
    hearing from Dr. Mira Sadgopal, who was then practising in Hoshangabad District
    in Madhya Pradesh, about a birth she had been called to in a poor villager&#8217;s
    hut. The woman was in bad shape and the baby&#8217;s shoulder was stuck&#8212;she
    couldn&#8217;t do anything and so she had told the family to arrange for transport
    to the nearest hospital miles away. In the meantime a very elderly, blind <em>dai</em>
    was called (just the kind attacked in the colonial literature) and she managed to
    get the baby out alive. Everyone was amazed that this blind, wizened <em>dai</em>
    could do what the doctor could not.
    <br />
    <br />
    Often people think of dais as &#8216;wise women&#8217; and intuitive (both of which
    they may be). But Singh&#8217;s and Mehrotra&#8217;s papers unpack not only &#8216;beliefs&#8217;,
    as they are disparagingly called by those who feel themselves superior by virtue
    of &#8216;science&#8217;, but also the cognitive systems which they play out in
    their practice. These diagnostics and therapeutics rely on touch, natural resources,
    ritual and image, and supportive networks of women. Again, one is not advocating
    blind dais attending births, but only questioning the absence of appreciation of
    methods, and methodologies, which utilize capacities of empathy, intuition and imagination
    alongside the very hands-on skills of touch: massage, manipulation, repositioning
    of the baby&#8217;s body (a practice which is only recently coming into vogue in
    the west).
    <br />
    <br />
    The subject matter of both Singh&#8217;s paper on Ayurveda, and Mehrotra&#8217;s
    on the nexus between birth experience, knowledge and rights, fundamentally challenge
    classic Western epistemological notions. The retrieval of Ayurveda involves the
    recognition of a classic knowledge base distinct from western epistemologies. The
    mega theory of Indian civilizational knowledge does not change when new findings
    are &#8216;discovered&#8217;. Einstein revolutionized physics and Newtonian theory
    was replaced; again quantum physics set aside some of Einstein&#8217;s propositions.
    This paradigm shift does not take place in Ayurveda. As it is practiced today the
    foundational theoretical principles remain unchanged. The building blocks of <em>panchmahabhuta</em>;
    <em>kapha, pitta</em> and <em>vata</em>;<em> rasa</em> are fundamentals of this
    indigenous system which remain the same.
    <br />
    <br />
    A similar view of traditional healing systems&#8217; unchanging knowledge base is
    presented in a recent article in the journal <em>Social Science and Medicine</em>.
    Stella R. Quah, based on her research in Singapore, explores the challenges that
    the &#8216;ethos of science&#8217; poses to traditional Chinese medical practitioners<sup></sup>.<sup><a
        href="#41">41</a></sup> Quah proposes that there are two sets of norms in Chinese
    medicine: the norm on knowledge, and the norm on practice. In considering &#8220;knowledge
    creation,&#8221; she identifies the same understanding underlying Ayurvedic claims&#8212;that
    at the conceptual level, pioneering knowledge is unnecessary because the fundamental
    principles of Chinese medicine were already provided in the classics of Chinese
    thought. Furthermore the contributions of each generation of Chinese practitioners
    rested on the accumulation of empirical data supporting these fundamental principles.
    &#8220;Thus experience is always understood in terms of basic principles learned
    from superior knowers.&#8221; This sounds terribly hierarchical, and it is&#8212;but
    we are challenged to examine these claims rationally. In fact Ayurveda and traditional
    Chinese medicine are effective, many times providing healing to those whom biomedical
    practitioners have declared incurable.
    <br />
    <br />
    Anuradha Singh also recommends Ayurveda as a system which privileges the subjective
    experience of the pregnant woman and accommodates her individual perceptions, sensations,
    desires&#8212;all within it&#8217;s classificatory system. She states that within
    Ayurveda the woman/mother is both the kshetra, field (i.e. body), and the <em>kshetrajna</em>
    field-knower (the one who knows the body). This is a radical departure from the
    more common understanding of this image/homology embedded in the Samkhya philosophy
    system, but also active in the folk imagination, and even legal frameworks. <em>Purush</em>,
    the cosmic man, is the field-knower, whereas <em>prakriti</em>, the world of form
    or matter, is considered the female. Theoretically this philosophical system is
    not gendered, but, as many feminist writers have shown, in practice it is not only
    gendered, but also hierarchically gendered&#8212;with the male as knower, with entitlements
    and power; and the female rendered as object to be known, possessed. As anthropologist
    Leela Dube has shown, the rights to possession of property and to children are given
    to &#8220;he who has the seed,&#8221; i.e. the male.
    <br />
    <br />
    Singh retrieves the image of the field-knower from the texts in a different register&#8212;that
    of the woman subject observing her own body/self processes (heat/cool, emotions,
    energy, pain, desires) in order to diagnose and heal, yes, but also be embodied
    &#8216;participant observer&#8217;, if you will, to the miracle of creating new
    life. And it is this embodied knowing of self that signifies a domain similar to
    that of Lal Ded, Akka and the other besharam women&#8212;only now, and especially
    within the conservative textual tradition, husbanded and in the service of patriliny.
    <br />
    <br />
    Within a bio-medical framework the procreative body is known as the re-productive
    body. Obstetric language uses terminology drawn from an industrial model&#8212;a
    woman labours; the baby is delivered; contractions may be false, there may be failure
    to progress. The individual experience of the mother is not accommodated for within
    this medical view. As Jessica Mitford writes in her <em>The American Way of Birth</em>
    <blockquote>
        The whole concept of a preordained average time for the various stages of labour,
        from which one deviates at one&#8217;s peril is absurd to trained midwives, who
        know from experience that there is no &#8220;norm,&#8221; each case presenting its
        own specific peculiarities of timing in which artificial deadlines have no place&#8212;are
        in fact, worse than meaningless<a href="#42"></a>.<a href="#42"><sup>42</sup></a></blockquote>
    Unfortunately this American way of birth has become the globalized, cosmopolitan
    obstetrics, which now totally dominates childbirth. Equally unfortunate is the lack
    of quality Ayurvedic practitioners handling birth within India. New Age guru Deepak
    Chopra, based in San Diego California, has franchised Ayurvedic &#8220;childbirth
    preparation&#8221; classes (and receives financial remuneration from franchisees).
    But unfortunately in the land of its origins Ayurveda, especially during pregnancy
    and birth, even with NGOs and &#8216;alternative&#8217; practitioners, is seldom
    utilized. Anuradha Singh&#8217;s contribution to this volume is both nostalgic and
    visionary&#8212;it presents a thorough exegesis of Ayurvedic texts on the subject
    in both philosophical and practical dimensions.
    <br />
    <br />
    Deepti Priya Mehrotra&#8217;s essay, on the other hand, speaks from the bottom up.
    <em>Birth Rights, Experiences and Knowledge Claims</em> (chapter 5) derives from
    her decades of familiarity with the realities of poor women&#8217;s lives&#8212;including
    their birth and body knowledge. Knowledge and practice is never de-contextualized&#8212;it
    is situated and the &#8216;knower&#8217; has her own subjective history. Mehrotra
    presents five birthgivers&#8217; narratives, &#8216;voices from the ground&#8217;
    as they tell their stories from within their socio-cultural matrix. Rich in emotion,
    belief, custom, relationship, geographic and economic circumstances, we get a sense
    of the life situations and personalities of the women. I am tempted to write &#8216;informants&#8217;.
    But they are not primarily providers of data&#8212;almost all of the women quoted
    in the paper have had an abiding relationship with Deepti; as colleagues, friends,
    fellow activists and NGO workers. This is precisely what public health statistics
    about maternal mortality and morbidity cannot capture. Statistics representing maternal
    and infant mortality and morbidity rates objectify, literally make objects/numbers
    out of human persons. Unfortunately because of funders&#8217; and government requirements,
    even the NGO sector (which is supposed to be innovative and humane) mostly collect
    their information on dais and birthgivers through questionnaires and interview schedules&#8212;because
    they are supposedly scientific!
    <br />
    <br />
    Mehrotra foregrounds the importance of <em>experience</em> in the expression, transmission
    and development of traditional midwifery knowledge. Interestingly, in the public
    health and bio-medical literature, the <em>dai</em> is not regarded as a midwife,
    she is a TBA or traditional birth attendant. But who else beside the <em>dai</em>
    is the inheritor of the midwifery knowledge in the indigenous medical tradition?
    Still the status of midwife is denied to her by the powers-that-be, in part because
    these powers themselves do not comprehend the experience-based indigenous medical
    traditions. Quah, besides giving norms of knowledge (mentioned above) in her Singapore
    study, also presents norms of practice guiding traditional Chinese healers in what
    she calls the ethos of <em>pragmatic healing</em>. These norms are: a particularist
    approach; an emphasis on experiential knowledge; and the norm of empathy. Mehrotra&#8217;s
    narratives display these approaches in the caregivers whom she is documenting.
    <br />
    <br />
    As Mehrotra reminds us, for the majority of women who delivered at home, birth was
    part and parcel of ordinary life, not an isolated medical event. Fundamental to
    both her data, and that of Alpana Sagar, in her essay (chapter 8), is the fact that
    the majority of slum women voice a strong preference for birth at home, and elaborate
    on the reasons for that preference. Birth at home is an extension of the domestic
    sphere; women have always cooked, cleaned, cared for the young, elderly, sick. As
    much as some women may want to be &#8216;liberated&#8217; from the onerous burden
    of this work, we can still appreciate the value of caretaking activities. (For more
    on this see Subhadra Rai&#8217;s essay, chapter 7) This way of birthing and caretaking
    is steeped in relational ways of knowing, which are directly empirical, knowledge
    through the senses. Domesticity and birth were, and no longer are, high touch not
    high tech. Because they are embedded in relationships, dynamics and even decision-making
    are interactive, often collective. This is not to say that birth-at-home should
    be romanticized. Increasingly we are hearing from activists in the outlying slums
    of Delhi, where the poor are removed to make way for modernization and beautification,
    that birth in the<em> jhuggis</em> can be a horrible experience. There is no space
    or privacy for the labouring woman; with joint families disappearing, older women
    are not present to help the birthing woman.
    <br />
    <br />
    Interestingly the research methodology, presented by Mehrotra, is mimetic of the
    dais methods. &#8220;It was always clear that I am not doing research on these women,
    rather it is with and <em>for</em> them&#8212;and for myself too.&#8221; Just as
    the elderly dais call their work &#8216;<em>sewa ka kaam</em>&#8217; and consider
    it a &#8216;gift&#8217; and a &#8216;calling&#8217;&#8212;there is a relatedness
    and depth in both grounded research (catching women&#8217;s words and stories) and
    dais&#8217; catching babies. Qualitative social science research methods, as refined
    by feminist researchers, use active listening to communicate their respect for the
    speaker&#8217;s flow of words, memories, experiences. Whereas staccato interview
    questions only reach a superficial level of human experience, an engaged and skilful
    listener or group listening situation adeptly facilitated, reaches deeper levels
    of meaning. This is particularly important on topics of body, birth and the sacred.

    Deepti and I were colleagues in the MATRIKA project, and together we struggled to
    understand the figure of Bemata, the goddess often invoked at the time of birth.
    I have quoted Deepti in another volume <em>Invoking Goddesses</em>: Gender Politics
    in Indian Religion in this Shakti series:
    <blockquote>
        Imaged as a playful and rather fickle old woman, Bemata is amazingly familiar and
        at the same time a divine persona. She is invoked at the time of childbirth being
        the special patron of dais and parturient women. Living underground, she creates
        human beings out of earth, breathing life into them and writes their fate on their
        foreheads shortly after birth. Bemata is immanent in all nature, grows and protects
        the baby in the womb, but also seems to be responsible for complications if she
        does not &#8216;exit&#8217; the mother&#8217;s body via postpartum bleeding. She
        is understood to leave the birth home at the time of the chatti rite, six days after
        birth when she is thanked for growing and protecting the baby. However, she is also
        perceived as being responsible for diseases of mother and child in the postpartum
        period<sup></sup>.<sup><a href="#43">43</a></sup>
    </blockquote>
    In the process of deciphering the word pictures and imagistic understandings of
    the <em>dais</em>, we drew pictures of our ideas about what they were saying, a
    form of visual &#8220;active listening.&#8221; Deepti sketched a crayon drawing
    of the Bemata figure, dividing the paper into three layers. At the bottom of the
    page is the underground, or &#8216;<em>narak</em>&#8217; where Bemata depicted gleefully
    pushing babies up into the realm above and likewise growing a plant. In the middle
    section, in the mundane world, one woman has a baby in her belly while another,
    postpartum, allows the lochial blood to return to the earth, as the plant grows.
    Finally in the top section, the sun is shining. Posters like these were returned
    to groups of dais to see if we had &#8216;got it right&#8217;.
    <br />
    <br />
    These kinds of unconventional methods, using empathy, artistry and imagination,
    are crucial to the reclamation and understanding of indigenous birth knowledges
    and ways of knowing. &#8220;Scientific&#8221; knowledge is based on propositional
    knowledge, that there is one &#8216;truth&#8217; that can be stated. It is not embodied
    and situated, it is, to coin a phrase &#8216;enworded&#8217;&#8212;put into words
    or numbers. The &#8216;scientific method&#8217; involves hypothesis, analysis, thesis,
    verification and repeatability. By its very nature it is reductive; verification
    can only take place within a circumscribed framework. Childbirth, I would argue,
    is by its very nature &#8216;<em>jungli</em>&#8217; or out of bounds of convention.
    In a hospital a doctor might never know the concerns which plague the labouring
    woman (was she abused as a child? Is she afraid of bearing yet another daughter
    in a family which wants a son? Is she battered in her marriage?) Normal human labour
    is a hormonal process. The body&#8217;s hormonal system functions efficiently when
    it is not under stress, when the woman is being nurtured and her physical, emotional,
    social, spiritual and psychological needs are being met. How can this complex web
    of factors be handled by scientific thesis?<br />

    <em>Dais</em>&#8217; norms of practice are similar to the ones Quah describes in
    Chinese traditional practitioners. Paying attention to the particulars of the labouring
    woman; an emphasis on knowledge gained by experience; and the crucial importance
    of empathy.
    <blockquote>
        The practice gives priority to the identification of the unique features of a patients&#8217;
        ailment over the similarities that the case may share with others&#8230;<br />
        <br />
        The norm of experiential knowledge indicates that direct knowledge of the patient&#8217;s
        ailment is a fundamental prerequisite. It is through palpation that a practitioner
        establishes whether there is local hardness or dilated vessels or raised temperatures,
        all of which could suggest obstruction of the Qi channels.
        <br />
        <br />
        The third norm is empathy&#8212;the practitioner must empathize with the pain which
        the patient experiences and share his anxieties. He or she should be kind-hearted
        or benevolent&#8212;a good doctor is someone who understands.</blockquote>
    Focus on the individuality of the woman, the particulars of her experience; respect
    for knowledge gained through hands-on experience; and an empathetic relationship
    with the labouring woman&#8212;all these mark the women who attend birth &#8216;traditionally&#8217;.
    <br />
    <br />
    These women know the body through what they do, through sense experience and they
    are keen observers of energy. They may not be able to read books and charts, but
    they read the body in a myriad of ways. Unfortunately the whole enterprise of &#8216;development&#8217;
    seems to be erasing, or corrupting these ways of knowing. Dai training programs
    are bio-medically based, hierarchical (where trainers who may have attended no births
    teach dais who often have attended hundreds), and focused on anatomical charts that
    have no resemblance to <em>dais</em>&#8217; own mappings of the body.
    <br />
    <br />
    I remember years ago when I started hearing about the danger of &#8220;the placenta
    moving up into the chest.&#8221; Of course the literal placenta cannot cross the
    diaphragm and go into the chest. But as a childbirth educator, I knew that at the
    time of pushing the baby out, women often exert energy in the chest and throat,
    and not in their bellies. So we have to tell them &#8220;don&#8217;t push from your
    chest but from your belly.&#8221; Similarly, I figured that the placenta &#8220;moving
    into the chest&#8221; was referring to energy not to the literal organ, the placenta.
    What is being signified here is that the energy, which should be moving the afterbirth
    down and out of the body, is stuck in the upper body. I have heard so many doctors
    scoff at the ignorance of women who refer to this phenomenon in this way. &#8220;Ha-ha,
    these <em>dais/women</em> are so ignorant that they don&#8217;t even know that a
    placenta can not move into the chest.&#8221; It&#8217;s a basic problem of miscommunication&#8212;whereas
    the bio-medical, literate trainers &#8216;know&#8217; the body in terms of matter,
    organs, discrete physiological systems (circulatory, nervous, hormonal), the traditionally
    oriented speak in an image-laden language which represents energetic processes.
    <br />
    <br />
    Quah concludes that the traditional Chinese medicine is incompatible with the ethos
    of science. She sees that the pressures to comply with official health regulations,
    and the inability to succeed under the ethos of science, pose an onerous challenge
    to practitioners. The same seems to be true, even more so with the <em>dais</em>&#8212;today
    they are being utilized (and paid) for bringing labouring women to the hospital
    and motivating sterilization cases. This program is the deepest form of betrayal
    of Indian women&#8217;s midwifery knowledge. Many dais have the trust and respect
    of their communities. The state, perceiving this special relationship, uses dais,
    human resources, to gain entry into &#8220;underserved&#8221; areas, or communities
    that are self reliant and resourceful in handling their own births. Again this is
    stated with the caveat that the state is responsible for quality back-up services
    for poor women, not for universalising bio-medically handled birth. So dais are
    being paid to erase their own tradition; to deliver poor women to substandard hospitals
    and clinics, often private; and serve as barefoot touts for pharmaceutical and medical
    profit.
    <br />
    <br />
    Mehrotra questions this universalising of the biomedical approach to birth as if
    it would secure women&#8217;s rights. She suggests universal rights need to be put
    forward; right to food; right to choose to birth traditionally; rights to high quality
    medical services and access to diverse information on birthing. She also places
    advocacy for indigenous birth knowledge within the people&#8217;s science movement,
    as yet another domain of indigenous knowledge being replaced by modernity; consumerism;
    mass culture.
    <br />
    <br />
    Concepts of the human body and its place in the world or cosmos are central to any
    culture. Likewise, care of the body, the health behaviour, which the mother, family
    or community inculcates into the child as a part of socialisation, are intrinsically
    cultural orientations. Unfortunately the powerful language of human rights used
    in CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women)
    and Safe Motherhood literature/discourse seems to ignore the existence of indigenous
    systems of health, healing and medicine in the effort to guarantee access to modern
    medical facilities to women and prevent economic and gender based discrimination.
    Most NGO human rights initiatives have not addressed economic, social and cultural
    rights, in part because of the near total absence of any methodology to monitor
    enforcement or define violations of them.
    <br />
    <br />
    Increasingly the language of women&#8217;s human rights to health care includes
    &#8216;accessibility&#8217; of that care&#8212;not just physical but also social
    accessibility. This acknowledges the importance of an attitude on the part of health
    care providers compatible with women&#8217;s beliefs and respectful of her cultural
    practices. Women are reluctant to use health services, in part, because they perceive
    health care providers to be rude, patronising and insensitive to the contexts in
    which they live. Interactions with providers can be threatening and humiliating,
    and women often feel pressured to make choices that conflict with their own health
    and fertility goals.
    <br />
    <br />
    Naming the human rights of women to choose, as practitioners and as users, indigenous
    health modalities and specialists is an important step in enumerating rights. The
    language of choice should not only extend to cafeteria style approaches to birth
    control techniques and family planning. A woman should be able to choose to squat,
    rather than lie down on a delivery table (or perform a ritual or be accompanied
    by a loved one), as she births her baby-and still avail herself of the advantages
    of bio-medical services or back up.
    <br />

    <h3>
        Problem of Birth Work&#8212;Impure or Pure?</h3>
    As we considered in the beginning of this essay, birth is &#8216;<em>sharam ki baat</em>&#8217;&#8212;to
    be kept separate from the &#8216;sacred&#8217; and men, it is also ritually unclean
    or polluted. Strange, isn&#8217;t it, that the word &#8216;pollution&#8217; signifies
    in such radically different discourses as the environmental waste which is poisoning
    our planet, and the priestly injunctions against menstruating and postpartum (bleeding)
    women &#8216;contaminating&#8217; sacred spaces with their procreative bodies? The
    modern mind would think there is absolutely no relationship between these two sets
    of phenomena. We might view pollution, as Mary Douglas does, as &#8220;matter out
    of place.&#8221; However this essay proposes an analysis that probes that linkage
    between the violation of our mother earth and the desacralization of the maternal
    body in &#8216;genealogies&#8217; of gender, the sacred and the cosmos. It also
    sets out how these ideas and pragmatic realities impact the handling of birth&#8212;and
    the handlers of birth. Birth is a rather messy affair, with all kinds of bodily
    fluids and &#8220;afterbirth&#8221; (waste) oozing. And those who literally handle
    the birthing body and clean up the place afterwards are never a part of the local
    hierarchy be it in a hospital in New York City, a <em>safai karmchari</em> in a
    nursing home in Delhi or a <em>dhanuk</em>, cord-cutter and postpartum worker in
    rural Sitapur&#8212;see Sarah Pinto&#8217;s work in this volume.
    <br />
    <br />
    My own personal experience of many years living and travelling, attending births
    and interacting with <em>dais </em>in many parts of India is the ground of this
    analysis. And yes it may be seen as homogenizing and totalising&#8212;a meta-analysis,
    if you will, and an essentialist one. To play on words again, it is this concept
    of &#8216;fertility&#8217; and generativity that links the maternal body with the
    fecund soil. In the Indian imagination, I would argue, one does not &#8216;symbolize&#8217;
    the other. Woman is not a symbol of the earth nor does the earth &#8216;symbolize&#8217;
    woman. The relationship is deeper than that. A power adheres within earth body and
    female body&#8212;one that ultimately lies outside of male control. This is the
    essential meaning of &#8216;virgin&#8217;&#8212;not chaste or untouched. But rather,
    not &#8216;husbanded&#8217; not under patriarchal control&#8212;as a virgin forest,
    which is generative, but not &#8216;husbanded&#8217; or possessed by any man. This
    is a the <em>jungli </em>power which underlies practices of magic and alchemy; and
    is being tinkered with by scientists in white coats practicing genetic engineering,
    cloning, and other control techniques.
    <br />
    <br />
    So what is this bodily and earthly fertile dirt? And how did we come to be so confused
    about it? And how did the women who handled the &#8216;dirt&#8217; of birth come
    to be stigmatised for that work? When I was studying theology and pollution &#8216;taboos&#8217;
    I remember reading that the same word was used in Aramaic to describe the polluted
    blood of the female body and that of the alluvial soil that is so regenerative,
    on the banks of the river. Sanskrit scholar and brilliant radical thinker Giti Thadani
    pointed out the same overlap in the Sanskrit word &#8216;<em>mal</em>&#8217;. Body
    dirt&#8212;<em>mal</em> is what Parvati rubs off her body to make Ganesh. Indian
    deities, especially in their Puranic appearances, are embodied; they relieve themselves,
    copulate, breastfeed&#8212;nonetheless menstrual blood is repeatedly linked with
    the demonic. And, as I have written in an exploration of the origins of the menstrual
    taboos in the Rig Veda<a href="#44"></a>,<a href="#44"><sup>44</sup></a> in the
    early textual sources the demons are all referred to by matronymics rather than
    patronymics. That is, demons are matrilineal! We then need to deconstruct demon,
    the demonic and hellish within the Hindu Brahmanic context.
    <br />
    <br />
    Should we really be surprised by that &#8216;co-incidence&#8217; within staunchly
    patriarchal and patrilineal societies? Women&#8217;s blood, that of menstruation
    and postpartum, spill onto the pages of the so-called &#8216;legal texts&#8217;&#8212;the
    guidelines which have sought to regulate the lives of the Hindu high castes and
    Judeo-Christian-Islamic adherents. The assumption is that an orderly society demands
    the regulation of female sexuality and procreativity. A vital throbbing presence
    lurks behind the policing, however&#8212;that which we have been &#8216;historically&#8217;
    unable to access, as Uma Chakravarty has shown in her &#8220;Whatever Happened to
    the Vedic<em> Dasi</em>?&#8221;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#45">45</a></sup> My answer to
    the question, which Chakravarty poses in pointing out the high caste biases of &#8216;historical&#8217;
    writing, is that the Vedic <em>dasi</em> might be todays dai.
    <br />
    <br />
    We should not dismiss these matters thinking that menstrual and childbirth &#8216;taboos&#8217;
    are simply outdated superstitions relegated to the purview of archeologists of an
    ancient past. A recent conference &#8220;Pollution and Safety: Exploring the &#8216;Dirty&#8217;
    Side of Women&#8217;s Health&#8221; addressed an increasing body of research on
    aspects of pollution and women&#8217;s health.<sup><a href="#46">46</a></sup> The
    organizers put forward the following rationale:
    <blockquote>
        The development of modern health care and birthing practices has been associated
        with an emphasis upon safety and clinical cleanness along with significant changes
        in roles and beliefs. Yet themes of dirt recur, for instance, in research on practices
        within modern labour wards, around sexually transmitted diseases and in many medicalised
        aspects of women&#8217;s health care as well as in traditional settings.</blockquote>
    One of the papers presented at the conference, &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to wash
    you down&#8217;: the &#8216;dirty&#8217; vaginal examination&#8221; notes that notions
    of dirt are still associated with the examination of the vagina. This exam is a
    common procedure in labour, and is carried out by midwives and obstetricians, providing
    information about the opening of the cervix and the position of the fetus. Most
    labouring women in United Kingdom (and in hospitalized birth globally) experience
    two or three such exams.
    <br />
    <br />
    Midwife and midwifery lecturer Mary Stewart&#8217;s paper presented observational
    data from an ethnographic study exploring the &#8216;ritual&#8217; of the vaginal
    examination. She describes techniques used by midwives to prepare for the exam,
    (including the use of sterile packs, and washing of the woman&#8217;s genitalia)
    as well as data from discussions with midwives exploring the rationale behind these
    practices. She asserts
    <blockquote>
        &#8230;labouring women&#8217;s vaginas are perceived as &#8216;dirty&#8217; and
        that midwifery practice acts as a signifier of this. Midwives use the ritual of
        the VE (vaginal exam) as one strategy for demonstrating their considerable power
        over women and as a means of separating themselves, as &#8216;clean&#8217;, from
        the women, who are &#8216;dirty&#8217;.<br />
        <br />
        Midwives need to re-examine the rituals associated with VE and to re-consider both
        their practice and the words and language they use when preparing women for this
        intimate examination<a href="#47"></a>. <a href="#47"><sup>47</sup></a>
    </blockquote>
    Another conference paper examined a postpartum ritual which the author claimed foregrounds
    not the baby, nor the family, but the mother herself in a salutary manner. The use
    of language can be so powerful in illuminating social constructs as in this rite,
    the ritual of churching<sup><a href="#48">48</a></sup> used historically by the
    Christian church for purifying women after childbirth. Although regarded as an act
    of thanksgiving&#8230;as an opportunity for the woman to receive a celebratory blessing,
    that characterization, according to the writer, disguises the control that was exerted
    over parturient women and their midwives. Concepts of &#8216;uncleanness&#8217;
    and &#8216;pollution&#8217;<sup>&nbsp;<a href="#49">49</a></sup> associated with
    the churching of women had been in existence for hundreds of years before rapidly
    falling into decline in the early 20th century at the same time as modernism began
    to emerge.
    <br />
    <br />
    But let us consider, for a moment, what we might call genealogies of the sacred
    as they pertain to birth and birthgivers. This is important because attitudes and
    values tend to linger. Striking similarities exist between the Judeo-Christian-Islamic
    and the Brahmanic textual traditions in their treatment of the handling, and by
    implication the handlers, of birth. The Leviticus book of the Old Testament and
    the Dharamshastra texts of Brahmanic Hinduism both consider birth as defiling and
    pronounce in a myriad of diktats that both birth and menstruation should be set
    apart from the sacred activities of prayer, reading sacred texts; entering temple,
    church or mosque; or personal practice like meditation, yoga, etc. We must note
    that in these orthodoxies, women are desacralized at the height of their bodily
    power&#8212;their miraculous potential, to bring forth new human life into this
    world. There is a need for us to step outside of the notions and methodologies which
    position priestly voices and texts at the centre of gender analyses&#8212;and reclaim,
    re-image the blood of women and the work of birth, ritual and practical, from another
    perspective. This does not mean casting aside scholarly suspicion and naively re-enacting
    &#8216;tradition&#8217; however.
    <br />
    <br />
    Western feminist and anthropological scholarship, however, present other, more woman-centered,
    interpretations of these &#8216;dirty&#8217; female bodily processes<sup></sup>.<em><sup><a
        href="#50">50</a></sup>Blood Magic</em>: <em>An Anthropology of Menstruation</em>
    includes an essay<sup><a href="#51">51</a></sup> presenting data on menstrual synchrony
    from the Yurok Indians of Northern California&#8212;evidence which was clearly overlooked
    by early scholars because it just didn&#8217;t fit into their notions of women,
    society and the cosmos. The women of the Yurok tribe of Native Americans always
    attended an inter area celebration, but were never allowed to attend if they were
    menstruating&#8212;suggesting a seasonal menstrual time, when women menstruated
    collectively. Anthropologist Chris Knight presents an encyclopedia of data to support
    a new understanding of the construction of menstruation in his book <em>Blood Relations,
        Menstruation and the Origins of Culture</em>.<a href="#52"><sup>52</sup></a>
    Integrating perspectives of evolutionary biology, feminism and social anthropology
    within a Marxist framework, Knight rejects the common assumption that human culture
    was a modified extension of primate behaviours and argues instead that it was the
    product of an immense social, sexual, and political revolution initiated by women.
    <br />
    <br />
    Similarly we must ask questions of the &#8216;science&#8217; of the body that ignores
    vital questions of harmony, cyclicity and cosmic creative synchrony. Why do women
    bleed in 28-day cycles, similar to lunar cycles? Why do women who work, live, or
    are emotionally bonded together, menstruate together? How do their menstrual cycles
    come to align themselves? Did tribal groups of women, as some anthropologists have
    indicated, bleed collectively?
    <h3>
        Female Blood</h3>
    As mentioned above, female procreative blood and the demonic feminine have a long
    and hoary relationship in the Vedic and Brahmanic textual traditions. Indologist
    Wendy Doniger writes of the earliest textual reference to the demonic nature of
    female bodily fluids to be found in the Rig Veda where the blood of defloration
    is said to &#8220;claw and bite&#8221; the husband. In this case it is the hotr
    or priest who deals with the bloody sheet and removes the threat to the man and
    his family. This passage is referred to as &#8220;Suryaa&#8217;s Bridal&#8221;&#8212;Suryaa,
    being the feminine of Surya&#8212;the sun. (Today we are totally unfamiliar with
    the mythology of the feminine sun) This portion of the Rig Veda is the divine prototype
    for human, patriarchal, Hindu marriage ritual. Relevant portions (RV:10:85) read:
    <blockquote>
        May happiness be fated for you here through your progeny. Watch over this house
        as mistress. Mingle your body with that of your husband. The purple and red appears,
        a magic spirit; [Griffith translates &#8216;fiend] the stain is imprinted&#8230;Throw
        away the gown, and distribute wealth to the priests. It becomes a magic spirit walking
        on feet, and like the wife it draws near the husband.<br />
        <br />
        The body becomes ugly and sinisterly pale, if the husband with evil desire covers
        his sexual limb with his wife&#8217;s robe&#8230;It burns, it bites, and it has
        claws as dangerous a poison is to eat. Only the priest who knows the surya hymn
        is able to receive the bridal gown.<a href="#53"><sup>53</sup></a></blockquote>
    Male Indological scholars have glossed over this text, but recent women scholars
    have taken note, not just the blood of menstruation and childbirth, but also that
    of defloration&#8212;mentioned in the earliest existing sacred text&#8212;as demonic!
    How do these demons signify when read by foregrounding the gender politics of that
    time? And also when deconstructing the androcentric bias of subsequent interpreters?
    <br />
    <br />
    Likewise, menstruation has textual associations with both pollution and the demonic
    feminine. The Ayurvedic text, <em>Sushruta Samhita</em>, in the <em>Uttaram Tantra</em>
    presents the origins, causes, symptoms and treatment of &#8220;the nine diseases
    of infant life&#8221; in the form of demonic females. Then the demons/deities are
    located as creations of the gods and goddesses constituted by the menstrual fluid
    (&#8220;<em>Rajasa</em> essence&#8221;) of Ganga, Uma and Krittika. These demons/deities
    preside over the diseases of infants and &#8220;are all possessed of ethereal frames,
    divine effulgence and specific sex distinctions of their own.&#8221;
    <br />
    <br />
    In Julia Leslie&#8217;s<em> Roles and Rituals for Hindu Women</em>, it is emphasized
    that traditional purity-pollution concerns were still active in the Hindu mind.
    <br />
    <br />
    This concern for the magical powers connected with virginal blood still exists in
    Hindu society today. At our original workshops in 1987, several participants spontaneously
    adduced evidence that the blood of the first night, or of a girl&#8217;s first menstruation,
    continues to be given special ritual importance in a variety of Hindu communities.
    However, the ritual recipient of these polluting agents is now most often a woman
    (frequently a midwife or barber&#8217;s wife), who expects some auspicious gift
    in return for &#8216;absorbing&#8217; the magical dangers of the virginal blood<a
        href="#54"></a>.<a href="#54"><sup>54</sup></a>
    <br />
    <br />
    For our purposes here, in examining the constructions of birth-workers and work,
    it is important to note that the handler of the bloody sheet (and thus the demon)
    is the priest who knows the <em>surya</em> hymn. As one woman scholar points out,
    the work of removal of female blood and the energy which surrounds it needs to be
    performed by someone&#8212;and that someone, in the Rig Vedic context, is the <em>hotr</em>
    or priest. Within the context of the caste system, this function is performed for
    the blood of birth by the dai or, as Pinto explores in her paper, the <em>dhanuk</em>.
    Pinto shows, in her examination of the roles of birth workers (chapter 6), that
    in Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh, anyone can be a baby deliverer, but only a
    woman of the lowest caste of that area can be a cord-cutter, or dhanuk. We should
    not be surprised by the fact that elements of postpartum &#8216;trash&#8217; work
    extend into cosmological concerns with the women of the sweeper class, who literally
    handle the placenta, apply the oil to the bodies of mother and infant, wash the
    soiled clothes thus performing invaluable practical as well as religio-ritual roles.
    As Pinto points out, many emotional, linguistic and symbolic structures underpin
    this allocation of birth work tasks and ritual performances.
    <br />
    <br />
    I have been asking questions about this power to pollute for many years. Not simply
    an academic question, it seems to underlie much of distinctively Indian or South
    Asian attitudes to the body, especially the female body. Twenty years ago I journeyed
    to Mount Abu, Rajasthan with a British psychologist who was researching how different
    personality types were attracted to different kinds of gurus. I was interviewing
    holy women at the time. We stayed near the ashram of an intellectual woman guru,
    Vimila Thakur. When we walked drowsily into the 5 am meditation sessions we noticed
    that her secretary was &#8216;sitting outside&#8217; the meditation hall, looking
    dishevelled. Later, during an interview, my friend asked her why she was sitting
    at the entrance and not meditating every morning. The secretary responded by first
    asking us to turn off the tape recorder (menstruation being <em>sharam ki baat</em>)
    and told us that she was menstruating and, on further questioning, we learned that
    menstruating women are believed to emit certain &#8216;vibrations&#8217; at that
    time, and these vibrations would interfere with others&#8217; meditations. We packed
    up our interviewing paraphernalia and went down the road to a chai stall. My friend
    and I proceeded to argue about this &#8216;sitting outside&#8217; practice. &#8220;What
    is this?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Vimila Thakur is a modern, English speaking, educated
    guru, and a woman guru. Why is she promoting this superstitious nonsense? It&#8217;s
    irrational and insulting to women.&#8221; My mind was working on a different track.
    &#8220;What is this power, this bodily capacity to disrupt meditations? And how
    could we understand that power in a different way&#8212;that would be more woman-friendly?&#8221;
    Thus began both my interrogation of the modernist understandings of &#8216;superstitious&#8217;
    taboos and my research on the ritualization of female bodily processes and how these
    ritual spaces could be viewed more positively.
    <h3>
        Female Spaces</h3>
    On the Indian subcontinent, the women who handle birth invoke the realms of the
    &#8216;religious&#8217; but are considered outcaste and polluted by the religious
    authorities&#8212;and their communities have been fighting this stigma of &#8216;untouchability&#8217;
    long before India&#8217;s independence. But the basic conundrum faced here is that
    precisely while cordoning off spaces of menstruation and birth as polluting, the
    priestly sacred elites (and/or texts) left &#8216;private&#8217; female spaces where
    women (body, spirit, sex, motherhood, creativity, ritual and aesthetics) could play.
    The low or outcaste woman, by and large, was the ritual practitioner (with ritual
    inseparable from practice and knowledge) by tradition. The creation of domains of
    pollution and &#8216;untouchability&#8217; functioned to protect women&#8217;s bodily
    spaces, rituals and practice from Brahmanic incursions. All other life-cycle rituals
    have evolved into priestly purview, but apart from the Atharva Vedic birth <em>mantras</em>&#8212;there
    are no priestly rituals at birth. Here the Brahmin priests are &#8216;sitting outside&#8217;!
    As Anuradha Singh mentions in her essay, the Ayurvedic texts remain silent on the
    time of cutting the umbilical cord. Why? Because the high caste textual authors
    and practitioners concerned themselves with applying Ayurvedic theory to the birth
    moment. They were not involved in the hands-on caring for the labouring woman nor
    severing of that fleshy cord, nor cleaning up messy stuff. Conversely the <em>dais</em>
    and &#8216;other women&#8217; who handle birth, once they get talking will not be
    quiet about these moments and their significance.
    <br />
    <br />
    Although dais often use some of the language of caste Hindu as well as Sikh, Muslim
    and Christian orthodoxy, denoting the defiling nature of birth, older dais maintain
    a healthy distance and ironic disdain for attitudes which demean their work. Rukhma
    Dadi, when interviewed by Samira Jain for her film<em> Born at Home</em>, laughed
    as she related how it is said she &#8216;sinned&#8217; by cutting so many umbilical
    cords. Her sardonic chuckle demonstrated an embodied confidence and ironic distance
    from such pejorative attitudes. Inheritors of the dai tradition see themselves primarily
    as servants of the life force, or jee. And the placenta is viewed as the repository
    of <em>jee<sup></sup></em>.<em><sup><a href="#55">55</a></sup></em>
    <br />
    <br />
    I should mention here that to my knowledge, generally, <em>dais</em> serve the women
    of religious communities other than their own. Both in our early research in the
    slums of Delhi and during our MATRIKA research in four areas of North India, religion
    was not an issue of who served whom&#8212;caste was! And all religions, Hindu, Muslim,
    Sikh and Christian had some form of caste. And again, generally according to tradition,
    <em>dais</em> and other birth workers were from the lowest or outcaste groups. It&#8217;s
    almost as though this birth work, particularly handling bodily fluids and afterbirth,
    was transacted beneath and radar screen of religious orthodoxies and configurations.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
        Placenta as &#8216;Phool&#8217; (Flower), Newborn as &#8216;Phul&#8217; (Fruit)</h3>
    The placenta, the organ interfacing maternal and fetal systems, is referred to,
    and revered as, &#8220;another mother&#8221; to the child. One <em>dai </em>said
    &#8220;We never throw the placenta away. The child is so dear to us, so is the placenta
    dear to us. For nine months it has protected and supported the baby, so how can
    we throw it away?&#8221; <em>Dais</em> consider the placenta to be the flower and
    the baby, the fruit. The afterbirth, the most polluting of substances in the <em>Dharamshastras</em>,
    is buried by the <em>dai</em> with rite and prayer for the newborn child. How the
    placenta is treated is believed to affect the well being of the child. These rituals
    honouring the placenta assume vital correlations between the human body and the
    earth body. And the <em>dai</em> negotiates these worlds and the embodied maternal-newborn
    relationship.
    <br />
    <br />
    Caste and gender intersect in an extraordinary way here. Let&#8217;s get the rules
    of caste straight&#8212;strictly speaking, by <em>Dharamshastric</em> definition,
    all women are <em>shudras</em> because they menstruate. Modernity has obscured and
    in many cases erased, much of female body-based &#8216;spirituality&#8217;, ritual
    and practical, by solely focusing on high caste, textual sources and not the religiosity
    of female spaces and the low or outcaste ritual specialists.
    <br />
    <br />
    Within the context of modern, globalised societies, religion and medicine are entirely
    separate enterprises. The medical doctor usually does not pray before entering the
    consulting room or operation theatre. The priest usually does not heal, except for
    counsel about the spiritual realm. The body is the doctors&#8217; purview. The soul,
    or spirit, is that of the priests. This Cartesian dualism, however, is not observed
    in pre-modern, or even postmodern societies. The vast number of &#8220;New Age&#8221;
    web sites confirms that many &#8216;seekers&#8217; in the dislocated global context
    desire &#8220;holistic&#8221; practices and practitioners. For example the hundreds
    of web pages devoted to Indian or Hindu pregnancy rituals testify to the re-invention
    of tradition&#8212;the global diaspora desperately seeking to reconnect to the ritual
    practice of their elders (and the <em>dais</em>, <em>nains</em>,<em> bais</em> and
    others who helped both practically and ritually during parturition&#8212;though
    in cyberspace they loose the touch and the sociability of these interactions).
    <br />
    <br />
    In their introduction to<em> Decolonizing Knowledge</em>: <em>From Development to Dialogue</em>,
    editors Frederique Apffel-Marglin and Stephen A. Marglin write of the divergence
    between the ancient Greeks and modern &#8220;scientific&#8221; cosmo-visions and
    ways of knowing the world.
    <blockquote>
        For the Greeks, understanding the world was an ethical pursuit. Modern rationality
        by contrast is disengaged not only from the body and the world but from ethics as
        well, or rather the world for us is no longer a sacred cosmos and the laws of nature
        are silent as to the good and the beautiful.
    </blockquote>
    They quote Albert Einstein on the issue.
    <blockquote>
        &#8220;The concepts which [the scientific way of thinking] uses to build up its
        coherent systems do not express emotions. For the scientist, there is only &#8216;being&#8217;,
        but no wishing, no valuing, no good, no evil&#8212;in short, no goal&#8221;&#8230;</blockquote>
    The Good that inhered in the cosmos for the Classical Greek was eventually replaced
    by the Good that faith in God enables one to attain. What made the new mode of knowing
    ultimately triumphant&#8230;is the fact that the new neutral ground created by it
    did not fundamentally challenge Christian doctrine, either Catholic or Protestant.
    The new mechanistic de-spiritualized objects of knowledge contrasted in that respect
    with Renaissance magic: alchemy, astrology, sorcery and witchcraft<a href="#56"></a>.<a
        href="#56"><sup>56</sup></a>
    <br />
    <br />
    Birth (and female bodily fluids/powers) has/have always been seen as a site for
    witchcraft and sorcery. The knowledge and practice&#8212;and practitioners of woman-centred
    birth enact this belief that &#8220;good inheres in the cosmos,&#8221; not exclusively
    in any god or goddess; strength, guidance and blessings can be sourced from any
    fraction of the universe one has known and experienced. This multiplicity has been
    demeaned with the epithets &#8216;polytheism&#8217;, paganism, and superstition.
    Maternal bodies, as all human bodies, are not deemed to be separate from nature.
    As Singh points out, Ayurveda is grounded in the presupposition that the human body
    is composed of the same matter as that of all of nature, of the entire cosmos.
    <h3>
        Narak as Fertile Ground</h3>
    The MATRIKA team was sitting on my drawing room floor, mulling over how to translate
    the phrase &#8220;<em>nau mahene ka narak kund</em>&#8221; or &#8220;nine month&#8217;s
    hellish (or demonic) pond&#8221;&#8212;used by the dais to signify the afterbirth
    or placenta, cord, amniotic sac. We knew we were not dealing with the Christian
    &#8220;fire and brimstone&#8221; hell, the abode of the damned. But even the Hindi
    word &#8216;<em>narak</em>&#8217; is translated into English as hell, also with
    negative associations. We were discussing what exactly a <em>kund</em> was, how
    to translate that into English and I said it was a spring-fed body of water, which
    had no streams running into it, but rather the water flowed up through the earth.
    As I moved my hand upside down, fingers pointing up to demonstrate the movement,
    I realized that that same gesturing had been used by my childbirth educators&#8217;
    class instructor to demonstrate the functioning of the placenta! Structurally and
    functionally the placenta and the <em>kund </em>are similar, an excellent example
    of simultaneous structure and functioning&#8212;which I subsequently verified with
    my geo-technical engineering PhD husband! Then my colleague Deepti Priya pointed
    out that the word &#8216;<em>kundalini</em>&#8217;, signifying the life force energy
    residing curled up at the base of the spine, had the same root word, <em>kund</em>.
    <br />
    <br />
    As I reflect back I realize that our MATRIKA team entered the <em>dais</em>&#8217;
    world of birth work through their word-pictures&#8212;and one of the central images
    was that of<em> narak</em>. During the first workshop in Gomia, Bihar one dai explained
    the meaning of <em>narak</em> to us in terms of menstruation and postpartum:
    <blockquote>
        Girls are considered holy before puberty. The marriage of a young girl (who has
        not had her periods) is performed with her sitting on her father&#8217;s lap. After
        puberty the woman is considered unclean, and is unholy, because she bleeds, and
        this is <em>narak</em>.
    </blockquote>
    Similarly she explained the postpartum ritual of chatti. Here rite and indigenous
    health practice (checking umbilical cord, bathing and cleaning of room) are seamlessly
    entwined. The isolation of the mother (confinement) provides rest for the new mother,
    relief from domestic responsibilities and time for bonding with the baby, as well
    as protection from communicable diseases carried by others.
    <blockquote>
        On chhati day (after birth) the narak period ends. The Dai checks if the umbilical
        cord has fallen off. Then she bathes the baby and beats a thaali (plate) and gives
        the baby to chachi (husband&#8217;s younger brother&#8217;s wife). Chachi does puja
        and gives the baby to jethani (husband&#8217;s elder brother&#8217;s wife). Then
        the woman is bathed and she wears new clothes. The dai then cleans the room where
        the delivery took place and the mother was kept separately for six days.
    </blockquote>
    I interpret the concept of <em>narak</em> as an ethno-medical concept allowing for
    a host of therapeutic interventions. <em>Narak</em> signifies the inner world of
    the body, invisible to the eye&#8212;particularly to the reproductive power of the
    female body. This concept then provides a mode of cognition through which practitioners
    utilize diagnostics and therapeutics that do not violate the integrity of the body.
    And dais&#8217; health modalities are high-touch (massage, pressure, manipulation);
    use natural resources (mud, baths and fomentation, herbs); and application of &#8216;hot
    and cold&#8217; (in food and drink, fomentation etc.); isolation and protection
    (from household work and maternal and sexual obligations).
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Dais </em>refer to the postpartum period as &#8220;narak ka samay&#8221; or
    hellish or demonic time. And narak is also spoken of as the underground and fertile
    realm where Bemata dwells. <em>Dais</em> use the term without distaste or moral
    judgment. The following quote from a Rajasthani dai elaborates the postpartum care
    that helps us appreciate how entwined the concept of <em>narak</em> is with an ethno-medical
    approach.
    <blockquote>
        Till the <em>jachcha</em> has a bath, a name is given to the baby and puja is done&#8212;she
        is considered unclean (<em>chhutak</em>). After bathing the new mother, the room
        is also cleaned. Till this day only dai was touching her and taking care of her.
        Nobody from the house was touching the jachcha. Dai massages the new mother and
        the new baby. There is a tradition to use wheat grain flour, ghee and turmeric for
        massage. This softens<em> jachcha&#8217;s</em> skin and her skin glows like that
        of a new bride. Her shareer is cleaned with warm water and <em>rangjhar</em> (a
        herb) water. We boil <em>rangjhar</em> and put ghee in this water and make the new
        mother sit in it. This helps in fomentation and prevents infection and is done for
        three-four days. If the woman gets a perineum tear then we soak cotton in ghee and
        turmeric and keep it on the tear for three-four days.
    </blockquote>
    Whereas traditionally <em>narak </em>signified within the domain of sacred nature,
    thanks to the horrific combine of priestly purity and scientific rationality the
    balance between heaven and earth has been lost. Also, balance between male and female&#8212;even
    as we are being &#8216;liberated&#8217; from &#8216;tradition&#8217; we have lost
    our bodily spaces; the normative body is now the male body. Not the body which bleeds
    monthly nor grows babies in wombs nor feeds them from her breasts. All these physiological
    processes are now socially and ritually invisible&#8212;or as Robbie Davis Floyd
    has written, are medically ritualised.<sup><a href="#57">57</a></sup>
    <h3>
        A Modern Dilemma? &#8211; Midwifery and the Status of the Midwife</h3>
    Four years ago, when I was a scholar in residence at a Massachusetts college, a
    group of midwives had introduced a bill to the state legislature to take certification
    of midwives out of the hands of the Nursing Council and create a separate &#8220;Midwifery
    Counsel.&#8221; The impetus for this move was to bring closer together the professional
    midwives, who were all nursing-trained, with the &#8220;lay&#8221; or &#8220;direct-entry&#8221;
    midwives&#8212;those who had acquired their skills informally, not through nursing
    education. I was already suspicious of such benign sounding moves, coming from Delhi
    where Safe Motherhood initiatives mainly aim to wipe out the dais, the sole birth
    practitioners available to many poor women. I questioned a woman who was proposing
    the legislation as to who (which groups of birth workers) would be further marginalised
    if this bill were to pass. She immediately recognized the motivation of the question
    and said they had already thought about this difficult decision. &#8220;The Native
    Americans, the street midwives, and the Amish.&#8221; She replied. These three groups
    perceive birth, birthgivers and birth workers as outside of the purview of state
    authority, thus they would not submit to &#8216;certification&#8217; by any board,
    be it nursing or midwifery. Native Americans and the Amish have their own &#8216;culture&#8217;
    of birth which is based on their own traditions&#8212;where spiritual is not separate
    from medical. Street midwives serve women from groups of addicts, homeless, sex
    workers and others who are too poor or alienated to deal with institutions at the
    time of birth. Certification of lay and professional midwives commonly would benefit
    middle and upper classes&#8212;but it would further jeopardise those who do not
    work within a state system that insists on legitimisation (certification) and disciplines
    non-compliance with harassment by state forces.
    <br />
    <br />
    Midwife and academician Dr. Leslie Barclay writes of the shifting status of midwives
    within their social contexts.
    <blockquote>
        I find it fascinating how the term midwife appears and disappears from view according
        to the status or standing of midwifery and the person who practices it i.e. whether
        midwifery is &#8216;clean&#8217; or &#8216;dirty&#8217;. &#8230;some of these interesting
        questions are symbolic, but of significant consequence in the way midwives are seen,
        see themselves and act as agents of women within their own society.
        <br />
        <br />
        It has become clearer to me recently how words can identify &#8216;clean and dirty&#8217;
        groups and distinguish those valued groups (clean) from those being devalued (dirty).
        I remember when the term midwife was not used in Australia. Midwives have reclaimed
        the word which is now being used with pride and reappearing in titles such as Schools
        of Nursing and Midwifery&#8230;. The reappearance of the term in Australian language
        marks the reappearance of a health worker who is returning with strength and some
        authority. I would argue that &#8216;clean&#8217; in this sense is associated with
        high status and &#8216;dirty&#8217; is equivalent to having no language or name
        for work that is hidden or devalued.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another example, from the Peoples Republic of China demonstrates this further. In
        China there are two terms for the word midwife. Jiseng po is a &#8216;grandmother&#8217;
        midwife who catches the baby zucheng shi a professional midwife. In the last 10
        years national policy has decreed doctors and nurses (clean) are the people who
        should attend birth. Even the word for professional midwife has disappeared from
        health worker Acts and education systems. The term professional midwife survives
        only in Hong Kong and Taiwan. It is as if the pre modern jiseng po and the zucheng
        shi have become equally dirty and are associated with pre modern or feudal health
        care. Some of our current work is trying to explore why this has occurred and the
        consequences of this.<sup><a href="#58">58</a></sup></blockquote>

        Birth Work Appearance and Disappearance</h3>
    Sarah Pinto, in chapter 6 of this volume, &#8216;disappears&#8217; the idea of the
    &#8216;village midwife&#8217; in both her nurturing and nostalgic appearance, and
    her dirty, ignorant and superstition one. Utilising Veena Das&#8217;s &#8220;ecology
    of care&#8221; methodology she focuses on the social relations within which the
    provision of health care is embedded. Her attention to local detail and the manner
    in which social organisation (mainly caste) refracts through the work of birth allows
    her to elaborate a novel perspective on birth work and workers. One which lies outside
    the &#8220;idea&#8221; of the dai held in policy, NGO and civil society circles.
    She asks us to attend to places (like the placenta) where our attention doesn&#8217;t
    usually fall in intervention-oriented discussions. As Pinto, herself puts it, &#8220;It
    encourages us to think about the nature and meaning of Dalit women&#8217;s work,
    and about the social and political aspects of birth-workers&#8217; lives.&#8221;
    <br />
    <br />
    Pinto&#8217;s approach escapes the current global public health trap of invisibilizing
    the politics of caste and poverty. I am amazed at the continuities perpetuated in
    dominant discourses on <em>dais</em>. One can read contemporary Safe Motherhood
    writings and note the sanitized (i.e. non racist and more seemingly culturally sensitive)
    policy line that dais, or other women who handle birth, are basically responsible
    for maternal mortality and recognize the same line of reasoning which existed in
    colonial discussions. <em>Dai </em>training schemes had their origins in this colonial
    context, as Sagar reminds us in chapter 8 of this volume. And Pinto makes it clear
    that attitudes towards dais reflect the hegemonic idea that they, <em>dais</em>,
    were (and are) considered backward, that policies cleaning them up are steps on
    a road to national progress. She claims that these ideas and images relate more
    to institutional efforts to create &#8216;modernity&#8217; than to the shapes of
    tradition.
    <br />
    <br />
    And indeed contemporary health policy advocates institutionalised birth for all
    women, more as a marker on the road of progress, than from a pragmatic and patient-centred
    service provision point of view. Never mind the abysmal quality of existing health
    services in Delhi, and their non-existence in many rural areas. Never mind that
    most doctors and other trained personnel follow the money and refuse to work in
    rural areas. Don&#8217;t consider the fact that many women, desiring human support,
    quality of care and traditional practices, (see the data of Mehrotra and Sagar)
    don&#8217;t want to birth in hospitals. And don&#8217;t consider the fact that women&#8217;s
    health status is grossly compromised before they even become pregnant.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, under pressure from international NGOs,
    funders and United Nations bodies (Unicef, World Health Organization, United Nations
    Foundation for Population Activities), is now promoting the &#8216;solution&#8217;
    to high maternal mortality rates (MMR) as &#8216;skilled attendance at birth&#8217;
    and developing new cadres of birth workers&#8212;the SBA (skilled birth attendant)
    or the CBA (community birth attendant) as they are variously called. As Pinto points
    out
    <blockquote>
        In Sitapur, it is not necessarily that the denigration of female bodily fluids or
        the association of body-work with trash-removal makes dais something other than
        midwives. Rather, the range of categorically distinct kinds of work disappears the
        idea of the dai into a multiplicity of actors and processes.</blockquote>
    Attention to the distinction between the &#8220;<em>dhanuk</em>&#8221; (cord-cutter&#8212;who
    always belongs to the lowest caste of the area) and the &#8220;baby-deliverers&#8221;
    (who can be anyone) asks us to consider deeply gendered notions of the sacred. Observing
    the <em>dhanuk&#8217;s</em> work, cord-cutting, burial of the placenta, cleaning,
    massage, bathing and ritually progressing the mother back into her mundane status
    in the domestic sphere&#8212;all allow us to appreciate the services which she renders
    from an insider&#8217;s vantage point, rather than the conventional &#8216;social
    science&#8217; modernist &#8220;caste and gender discrimination is a terrible thing&#8221;
    point of view. Our MATRIKA research data, although not overtly exploring the separate
    roles of birth workers, corroborates Pinto&#8217;s insights on the heightened concerns
    with the cosmological and moral dimensions of cord-cutting, and the shifting valuations
    of hands-on postpartum care&#8212;at once socially at the lowest rung of caste hierarchy
    but at the same time of the utmost value to the woman and her family.
    <br />
    <br />
    In sharp contrast to our Western, &#8216;natural childbirth&#8217; and biomedical
    concerns with providing care during labour and getting the baby out, I have for
    many years, and in many places, noticed that danger, and woman&#8217;s needs during
    the postpartum time are perceived to be greatest. And indeed it is to these most
    outcaste of women that this care is entrusted. As Pinto puts it
    <blockquote>
        &#8230;the argument that caste is above all a matter of the body. It is the reproductive
        female body in particular, with its mix of the auspicious and the polluting, upon
        which meanings and socialities can be situated, performed, and rearticulated, particularly
        for those deemed untouchable.</blockquote>
    Interestingly, again according to Pinto, &#8220;Trained<em> dais</em>,&#8221; often
    post-partum workers, are encouraged by NGOs to &#8220;demand payment&#8221; from
    clients in the name of free enterprise, while compensation or support from the government
    are spurned. This is a globalized shift, from the domestic to the monetarized sphere.
    At an American Anthropological Association Meeting, Jane A. Szurek presented her
    research in Ghana, aptly titled &#8220;Teaching Women in Ghana to Pay for Childbirth:
    Redefining Midwifery for Economic Restructuring.&#8221; &nbsp;<a href="#59"><sup>59</sup></a>Commercialization
    of birth is not only a developing country phenomenon. In a recent publication <em>Consuming
        Motherhood</em>, the authors address the question of how motherhood and consumption,
    as ideologies and social action, mutually shape and constitute one another in North
    American and European social life.<sup><a href="#60">60</a></sup>
    <br />
    <br />
    The star role in postpartum concerns is played by the lowly, cast out placenta.
    The organ interfacing mother and fetus, is referred to within our MATRIKA data as
    &#8220;another mother&#8221; in it&#8217;s role of providing nutrients to the fetus,
    is often viewed with civilized distaste by those who live far from the daily realities
    of animal and human births, and deaths.
    <br />
    <br />
    As Pinto notes, in another section of her dissertation from which this paper is
    drawn, deconstruction of the village midwife, for purely sociological sake is not
    merely an exercise. There are power hierarchies playing themselves out with ironic
    incongruities.
    <blockquote>
        Where development and health care institutions are concerned, the performance of
        power via talk can indeed become a kind of pathology. Exaggerated versions of hierarchalized
        talk often play out in the space of institutional practice, in interactions between
        authorities and trainees/recipients, but not in policy discourse and institutional
        self-representation, where hierarchies are often denied through assertion of an
        explicitly &#8216;participatory approach&#8217;.</blockquote>
    Pinto points out that the concept of pollution has the power to delineate birth
    workers&#8217; roles. Although she correctly maintains that it is inappropriate
    to consider the dai a midwife by western standards, the disappearing midwife in
    the USA and the dirty Vaginal Exam reminds us that we moderns have not &#8216;disappeared&#8217;
    our own &#8216;dirtiness&#8217; ascribed to birth.
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Dhanuks</em>, in fact, barter and negotiate with families&#8212;they use their
    rather uniquely gendered agency (derived from handling the &#8216;untouchable&#8217;)
    in leveraging payment. It seems to me that what with doctors, science and the need
    for sterility, female bodily agencies and female spaces have shrunk.
    <br />
    <br />
    Human bonds, quintessentially exemplified in the bond between baby and placenta,
    and between mother and baby, are no longer meditated upon at the moment of cord-cutting.
    The slow death of placenta, once the repository of life force, is no longer a marker
    of cosmic cyclicity and sacrality. The messy afterbirth is now merely &#8216;garbage&#8217;.
    <br />
    <br />
    Female agency, however, is not just derived from handling the mess. Pinto, in her
    preliminary description of a birth in her fieldwork village, puts forward the concept
    of <em>barhriya</em>, an understanding of the womb and postpartum phenomena, not
    only at odds with western-derived anatomy and physiology, but actually attributing
    agency to the woman, womb, the female body. <em>Barhiya</em> wanders in the womb,
    searching for the baby&#8212;what we would call the contracting uterus. In biomedical
    renderings the womb, cervix are not at all sensitive, lacking in nerve fibers. The
    womb, in dais&#8217; conceptualisation, in a somato-psychic holism, is depicted
    as active, aware and &#8216;searching&#8217; for that which has been a part of the
    self for nine months!
    <h3>
        Birth Work: Sewa Ka Kaam or Income Generation?</h3>
    While Pinto&#8217;s deconstruction of the village midwife is sited in village Uttar
    Pradesh, and viewed through the lens of postmodern anthropology, Subhadra Rai&#8217;s
    advocacy tool of attributing monetary value to <em>dai</em> work was developed in
    Gujarat and during her research with SEWA (Self-Employed Women&#8217;s Association).
    Read against each other, one unpacks a caste-based agrarian social context while
    the other attempts to better the lot of the<em> dai</em> by assigning an economic
    value within an increasingly monetarized economic framework.
    <br />
    <br />
    Feminist analyses and gender-sensitive data reveal the inequities of women&#8217;s
    work throughout the world. Rai points out that the real economic value of dais&#8217;
    birth work, like that of housework, care of the young, elderly and sick, in addition
    to rural tasks of fetching water, cooking fuel, care of animals and seasonal agricultural
    work&#8212;have all been traditionally perceived by and evaluated from the patriarchal
    point of view&#8212;as extensions of the domestic sphere, thereby not REAL work.
    Rai suggests that methodologies be used to calculate the economic contribution of
    dais, in terms of what it would cost for an institutionalised health system to replace
    them with paid workers, could be used as an assessment of the financial savings
    to the health care budget&#8212;and the REAL cost to the exchequer if dais are phased
    out. She points out the extensive coverage of traditionally oriented birth practitioners,
    and the extent of their workload&#8212;and suggests that erasing and de-skilling
    these women will result in leaving the vast majority of women without any obstetric
    care.
    <br />
    <br />
    During the writing of this introduction a devastating tsunami hit the south Asian
    region. A colleague working with United Nations Fund for Population Activities,
    UNFPA, told me that hundreds of women were going into premature labour as a result
    of their trauma. Sri Lanka has done away with the dai system. All the hospitals
    are full and doctors are occupied with disaster victims&#8212;now that the dais
    have been de-skilled, who will care for the labouring women? International agencies
    are concerned&#8212;and yet they are propagating the modernist solution of &#8216;replacing&#8217;
    dais! However, the argument for a programmatic valuation of indigenous medicine
    and its human and cultural resource base is beginning to be heard in policy circles,
    especially as urban elites are turning to &#8216;alternative,&#8217; &#8216;complementary&#8217;
    and indigenous therapies.
    <br />
    <br />
    A recent article in S<em>ocial Science and Medicine </em>uses the term &#8220;cultural
    capital&#8221; to denote traditional body knowledge and resources. Elizabeth Chacko
    elaborates on such complementary therapies, really local and regional herbal remedies
    that have been a part of &#8216;folk&#8217; and Ayurvedic repertory, as they are
    used to treat diabetes. Chacko argues that greater attention needs to be paid to
    the broader systems of the environment and culture and their interconnections to
    understand the use of such therapies by persons with chronic illnesses. She explores
    respondents&#8217; knowledge and use of herbal therapeutics (often alongside biomedical
    ones) as well as how they came to know of these therapies. Identified by Pierre
    Bordieu, the concept of cultural capital includes benefits gained from early training
    and the home/cultural environment that is transmitted within the household from
    one generation to the next.<sup><a href="#61">61</a></sup>
    <br />
    <br />
    Rai&#8217;s effort is more a valuation of practitioner, rather than method (not
    that the two can be separated). But <em>dais</em> (and other women who attend birth
    and postpartum&#8212;keeping in mind Pinto&#8217;s cautions) are indeed the inheritors
    of India&#8217;s midwifery legacy. Although the knowledge and practice is decentralized
    and certainly not &#8216;professionalized&#8217;, indigenous reproductive health
    traditions should be considered &#8216;cultural capital&#8217;. Rai&#8217;s advocacy
    method, assigning monetary value to <em>dai</em> work, would enhance prospects of
    financial agency, although this is not entirely unproblematic within traditional
    societies where reciprocity often binds local relationships. (See Pinto&#8217;s
    paper for a critique of the NGO standardized approach which neglects the contours
    of birth worker roles in Uttar Pradesh.) Unfortunately these political-economic
    approaches to &#8216;reproductive health&#8217; may also function to promote the
    further commodification of health care.
    <br />
    <br />
    Rai acknowledges the caring and social aspects of <em>dais</em>&#8217; work in considering
    its gendered nature. &#8220;The non-economic frame of reference allows for better
    understanding of work&#8217;s social connotations where power, gender and culture
    intersect.&#8221; Birth work, she asserts, like other &#8216;women&#8217;s work,&#8217;
    is complex, multi-layered and gendered. And I would suggest that no work is as gendered
    as birth work. Standing, or squatting, between a woman&#8217;s legs as she pushes
    that baby out into the world is a consummately physiological and gendered act/work.
    <br />
    <br />
    Pointing to the social value of work Rai notes that psychological health of individuals
    and communities is also implicated. The deeply gendered work of caring for others,
    often inserted into the register of the domestic rather than that of economically
    productive, is implicated here and is at the heart of debates around recompense
    for midwifery. Although she doesn&#8217;t elaborate on this mental health perspective,
    the technological and pharmaceutical takeover of birth increasingly critiqued in
    developed countries has produced a &#8220;Humanization of Birth&#8221; movement.
    Within &#8220;technocratic&#8221; societies, many women have learned to fear birth:
    this fear is represented by the increase in caesarean section rates seen in many
    countries. It is posited that the &#8216;humanization of birth&#8217; may reduce
    this fear, and yet a paradox emerges&#8212;humanization is difficult to achieve
    in increasingly technocratic societies. The Humanization of Birth movement maintains
    that safety and self-fulfilling experiences are not contradictions and that humanized
    birth is the safest approach<sup></sup>.<sup><a href="#62">62</a></sup> Advocates
    of more humane birthing practices recognize that a woman needs individualized care
    while she is going through simultaneously a universal and, for her&#8212;a most
    unique, process. In talking about supporting natural or physiological birth, these
    humanization advocates are talking about skills, yes, but also about personal relationships.
    <br />
    <br />
    Rai grapples with <em>dais</em>&#8217; own perceptions that <em>dai </em>work is
    <em>poonya ka kaam</em> (good work),<em> dharm</em> (duty, religion),<em> blessings,
        happiness</em>, <em>help to the poor</em>, and <em>reciprocity</em>. She observes
    that dais live in an environment where there is a narrow margin of choices, and
    that they are reluctant to insist on payment for many reasons&#8212;among them the
    above ethical norms. However, Rai states that <em>dai </em>work is &#8216;necessary
    but culturally unappealing,&#8217; whereas Pinto sees that same &#8216;dirty work&#8217;
    as cultural leveraging available to insist on her terms of reimbursement.
    <br />
    <br />
    The paper proceeds to evaluate the relative merits of &#8216;opportunity costs&#8217;
    and &#8216;replacement costs&#8217; as methods for arriving at financial valuation
    of <em>dais</em>&#8217; work. Rai acknowledges the difficultly involved in measuring
    and tracking dais&#8217; tasks: the lack of available statistics, problems of difficult
    births and referrals. Secondly, a challenge arises from the variety of ways dais
    themselves define their work. Thirdly, standardized notions of hourly wages are
    not usually found in the government&#8217;s socio-economic or health publications.
    <br />
    <br />
    Rai critiques state policy viewing the <em>dais</em> as a &#8220;weak link&#8221;
    in the Gujarat government&#8217;s health system, as it minimizes their important
    contributions. <em>Dais</em> do conduct deliveries in both rural and urban settings.
    &#8220;Instead of seeing them as an essential link between poor women and the overburdened
    health care system, dais as a weak link hides the real reasons for dais responsibilities
    and involvement.&#8221; A question arises about how much can we expect the state
    to respond to these kinds of advocacies, agitations and demands, even though they
    may be completely rational and economically sound, considering Indian realities.
    Political will and public opinion would need to coalesce around these as priorities&#8212;and
    that doesn&#8217;t seem to be happening, especially when &#8220;Safe Motherhood&#8221;
    campaigns are dominated by those who want to mobilize opinion and resources, but
    don&#8217;t choose to address issues of poverty and the value and relevance of indigenous
    medicine and culture.
    <h3>
        Birth Work: Whose Business is it?</h3>
    Alpana Sagar displays an amazing critical reflexivity in her paper &#8220;Doctor&#8217;s
    Business or Women&#8217;s Business? Towards Making Childbirth Safer for Poor Women
    in India.&#8221; As a physician, she poses the question of how such disparate points
    of view came to exist between poor women, who view birth as natural and women&#8217;s
    business (although for serious complications they are eager to use modern medicine),
    and doctors who view every pregnancy as a potential risk. Sagar ambitiously sets
    out to answer this question, first providing the data from her research with women
    in the Gautam Nagar slum near Delhi&#8217;s premier medical institution&#8212;All
    India Medical Sciences Hospital, then tracing the history of the displacement of
    women, tradition and midwives from the birth arena, ideologically and practically,
    in both the Western, and the Indian contexts.
    <br />
    <br />
    Sagar&#8217;s paper, appearing in this volume, speaks to the larger issue of power
    politics as they impinge on the &#8216;private&#8217; and personal space of birth.
    Ideology, livelihood issues, hegemonic forces of colonial, class and state power
    in medieval Europe and post-Independence India emerge as crucial factors, as well
    as gendered notions of scientificity. Sagar provides ample data highlighting the
    scapegoating of women healers and midwives during the witchhunts that plagued Europe.
    She notes that social and political unrest was channeled against women healers and
    religious dissidents rather than popes and kings. Interestingly we might see a parallel
    in the British and post-colonial state and elites scapegoating<em> dais</em> rather
    than dealing with issues of poverty and providing quality rural referral services.
    <br />
    <br />
    Another gross omission from modern Indian discourse and memory (especially in that
    of women&#8217;s health and global health agencies) is the historical linkages which
    Sagar sketches between the eugenics movement, early birth control enterprises, and
    contemporary family planning or &#8220;health and family welfare&#8221; bureaucracies.
    The idea that some people &#8216;deserve&#8217; to reproduce, and others don&#8217;t
    was responsible for genocide, not only of Jews, but also Gypsies, homosexuals and
    the disabled in Nazi Germany. Post-war propaganda would have us believe that this
    was a uniquely German, or Nazi effort and ideology. However Sagar points out that
    such notable European and American figures as Thomas Huxley, Mathew Arnold, Havelock
    Ellis, H.G. Wells, Francis Crick and, of course, Adolf Hitler, were adherents of
    eugenic thought. Early advocates of &#8216;birth control&#8217; were eugenicists
    such as Margaret Sanger who is today celebrated by feminists for her freethinking
    and the delusion that birth control&#8217;s social contribution is liberating of
    women from biological dictates of motherhood. It is crucial for us today to recognize
    the historical linkage between &#8216;family planning&#8217; and eugenics because
    social, political and economic forces are colluding to form an ugly ideology that
    the poor, without money and resources, do not deserve to reproduce.
    <br />
    <br />
    While historicizing the various players assuming the role of birth workers and decision-makers,
    she indicts the colonial power&#8217;s maneuver of exporting problems from England
    to the colonies. In this case, newly trained women doctors, who were agitating to
    practice medicine at home&#8212;against the gender norms of the times, were encouraged
    to serve, convert and civilize the natives, and then return home with status and
    respectability. We have elaborated above on the ideological notion of the superiority
    of scientific medicine and temperament that operated in both the medieval European
    context and that of colonial and postcolonial takeover of birth from women and midwives.
    Goodness, harmony and balance are no longer believed to be an integral part of the
    cosmos and unruly nature (and natives) are to be conquered, civilized and controlled.
    A part of this project is the dislocation of indigenous medicine by Western medicine
    (the term used at the time) that presented itself as a universally applicable and
    superior form of therapeutics. Both biomedicine and public health, which delivers
    the services of biomedicine, envision a modernist trajectory, a straight line of
    heroic progress against disease. Nowhere is this enterprise more misguided than
    in its application in childbearing. The female body, as a life-bearing body, has
    been viewed as defective, a site for pathology. It is in this ideological context
    that Sagar views the displacement of women from birth and misguided policies and
    programme.
    <h3>
        How will the World be Born? Problems with Globalization</h3>
    Increasingly motherhood, or &#8216;reproduction&#8217; as the medical, academic
    and development establishments would have it, is moving from the margins of social
    science analysis to the centre. &#8216;Reproduction&#8217; is being used more productively
    to analyse the complex global terrains in which contemporary identities and societies
    are produced. The critical importance of how we human beings, as a species, give
    birth to ourselves, is finally being recognized. Consideration of motherhood/reproduction
    is no longer a soft, &#8216;domestic science&#8217;, a sentimental and womanly concern.
    We may be able to situate birth within its socio-economic and political context,
    a difficult enterprise, but achievable. But how, finally, can we image birth, in
    the realm of the imagination? How can we grapple with the mystery, the emotion,
    and the elemental rawness of birth alongside the statistics on maternal mortality?
    We risk being labeled as sentimental, essentialist, reactionary or even cultist
    if we talk, as the dais do, about the &#8216;life force&#8217; or &#8216;jee&#8217;<sup></sup>.<sup><a
        href="#63">63</a></sup> We have no English words for this life force that swells
    the belly and is tracked by the dai during labour unless we couch our terms in religious,
    therapeutic or &#8216;natural law&#8217; kinds of discourse. Some, nevertheless,
    attempt to articulate this.
    <br />
    <br />
    A recent article in the journal Social Science and Medicine, &#8220;Midwifery practice
    and the crisis of modernity: implications for the midwife,&#8221; deals with this
    dilemma by using Habermas&#8217;s notion of &#8216;the colonization of the lifeworld&#8217;
    to interpret data drawn from in-depth interviews with Irish midwives. The authors
    explore the tensions within the concept of modernity&#8212;between the emancipatory
    potential to liberate the human subject from the manacles of tradition and the application
    of reason to co-ordinate and control the natural world through scientific knowledge.
    Again, drawing on Habermas&#8217; theory of communicative action, they argue that
    the midwife&#8217;s role in facilitating the autonomous choices of women is impeded
    by the colonization of the lifeworld of labour and childbirth by the technocratic
    system of obstetrics. Labour is no longer a hormone-driven process&#8212;where the
    power to birth lies in a woman&#8217;s body. As Jo Murphy Lawless points out
    <blockquote>
        Illogically, at a time when women in wealthy post-industrial countries have never
        had better general health and with it, the opportunity to control their own fertility
        (thus largely eliminating the threats to pregnancy and labour that once accompanied
        prolonged childbearing), the rates of intervention have never been so high.<sup><a

    In the Irish study inductions, caesarians and other interventions during labour
    were routinely class based.
    <blockquote>
        Interventions were also determined by the civil status of the woman in terms of
        whether she was a public or a private patient. Private patients were subjected to
        a greater level of interventions because medical consultants were called to attend
        all private deliveries whether there was a problem at the time of delivery or not,
        whereas midwives had greater freedom to practice midwifery on public patients.<sup><a
            href="#65">65</a></sup></blockquote>
    A similar observation on interventions during labour based on class is made in a
    review of data on caesarean section rates in India.
    <blockquote>
        There is reason to believe that current rates are part of a rising trend. This cannot
        be attributed only to the rise in institutional deliveries because of the strong
        association between caesarean sections and private sector institutions&#8230;. In
        Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, the risk of
        undergoing caesarean section in private sector institutions is four or more times
        that of a public sector institution.<sup><a href="#66">66</a></sup></blockquote>
    Some medical and health policy journals even refer to a caesarean &#8216;epidemic&#8217;
    in developing countries. In &#8220;Over-medicalisation of Maternal Care in Developing
    Countries&#8221; the author concludes &#8220;the epidemic of C. sections continues
    in Latin America and extends into Asia. In addition there are signs of a worldwide
    epidemic of other interventions. There is an urgent need to build strong strategies
    to promote evidence-based interventions.&#8221;&nbsp;<sup> <a href="#67">67</a></sup>

    On one level this book indicts a bulwark of modernity (which also happen to be a
    site where vast numbers of marginalized poor seek to partake of the health resources
    more routinely available to the middle and upper classes) namely doctors, hospitals
    and the peripherals associated with them, particularly pharmaceuticals. One prominent
    south Asian physician, activist and pioneer in the production and distribution of
    quality generic drugs for the poor, Zafrulla Chowdry, noted that of all the irrational
    and harmful pharmaceutical use, the most occurred in the practice of gynecology
    and obstetrics.<sup><a href="#68">68</a></sup>
    <br />
    <br />
    However it is not the doctors, nor the medical professionals, nor the pharmaceutical
    businesses alone that are to be held responsible for high rates of surgical and
    pharmaceutical interventions. A recent sociological analysis of birth among middle
    class Calcutta families<sup><a href="#69">69</a></sup> claims that by far the majority
    of women prefer caesarean sections to normal vaginal births. The author, based on
    ethnographic fieldwork, contextualizes this preference in terms of the shift from
    the maternal home to the married home as site for birth and postpartum care, alongside
    the shift from home to hospital as place of birth. Traditionally, the daughter-in-law,
    in her married home is expected to perform domestic duties. The author presents
    an in-depth case study in which a mother reveals her preference for a caesarean
    in order to avoid the in-laws expectations of domestic work postpartum. The author
    views this decision as an exercise of agency and negotiating power. Although this
    paper is methodologically important, as it considers women&#8217;s &#8216;choice&#8217;
    of surgical birth in the context of specific marital and residential patterns, nevertheless
    the face-value acceptance of invasive surgery to avoid familial expectations as
    women&#8217;s power seems misguided to me. This shift in site of the parturient
    women from maike to<em> sasural</em>, is common to many locations and communities
    in India, as modernity erases tradition&#8212;in this sociologist&#8217;s view accompanied
    by surgical rites replacing religio-cultural ones.

    The crises of global capitalism, expansionist moves driven by the market economy,
    technocratic hyper-specialization plus a neo-liberal assault on provisions (ie.
    food distribution) for the underprivileged; these macro-level forces are miniaturized
    in birth situations. Everywhere in this country, in the most remote villages, women
    are being injected with oxytocics to induce or strengthen labour pains. One NGO
    head in Jharkand talked of needing to distribute bolts of cotton cloth for use as
    sanitary napkins and nappies.<sup><a href="#70">70</a></sup> In rural areas women
    now wear polyester saris and are not able to use their outworn cotton ones for these
    purposes. In a sense globalization recapitulates the colonial dilemma. Sustainability
    is touted in NGO funders proposal guidelines&#8212;supposedly leading to &#8216;development&#8217;
    while macro-level forces collude to disembowel local communities&#8217; sustainable
    lifestyles. Remember that Gandhians spun their own cloth and burnt mill-made cloth
    from England as a resistance tactic&#8212;the unavailability of cotton fabric for
    poor women&#8217;s use to sop up bodily fluids/wastes proves that the original vision
    of Gandhi was not just romantic non-sense.
    <br />
    <br />
    Likewise cooptation of intellectuals, occupying their narrow areas of specializations,
    NGOs and consultants all serve to camouflage the ugly face of the impoverishment
    which accompanies this neutral-sounding globalization. Similarly cultures, indeed
    civilizations reflecting various understandings of the human body, particularly
    the reproductive female body are sites of neo-colonialism via the ideology of scientific
    medicine&#8212;obstetrics and gynecology. Cultural homogenization minimizes diversity,
    resulting in, not choice but standardization&#8212;with insistence on the observable
    and measurable. Pluralism is eroded and knowledge is fragmented.
    <br />
    <br />
    Actually there is a deep irony in the fact that birth workers, <em>dais</em> and<em>
        dhanuks</em>, used to serve all women across caste and class hierarchies. And
    now they, themselves, their families and communities are literally outcastes to
    the benefits of both modern medical facilities and state-trained <em>dais</em> and
    ANMs (Auxiliary Nurse Midwives)&#8212;who often neglect to serve castes &#8216;below&#8217;
    their own. Building bridges between the best of the traditional and the modern can
    lead to better birthing for women of all classes. Many studies document the global
    poor-rich differences in the utilization of delivery care<sup><a href="#71">71</a></sup>
    as well as the unscientific practice/rituals of modern medicine in maternal health
    care. According to a recent article in the<em> International Journal of Gynecology </em>
    and <em>Obstetrics</em>, gaps between evidence and practice, (the current jargon
    of health care analyses), exist in the areas of clinical care, implementation of
    effective practices and in setting research priorities&#8212;essentially stating
    that countries with few resources should catch up with the current &#8216;scientific&#8217;
    evidence. Yet no one remembers the Western and modern origins of the &#8216;outdated&#8217;
    practices. A 1996 World Health Organization document<sup><a href="#72">72</a></sup>
    (which is not being circulated too much these days because of its flagrant violation
    in the vast majority of the world&#8217;s hospital delivery rooms) lists these practices
    that so violate the bodily integrity and dignity of the labouring woman:
    <ul>
        <li>Use of enema: enema is uncomfortable, can damage the bowel, and does not shorten
            labour or decrease neonatal infection or perinatal wound infection. </li>
        <li>Pubic shaving.</li>
        <li>Restriction of foods and fluids during labor.</li>
        <li>Repeated or frequent vaginal examinations.</li>
        <li>Routinely moving labouring woman to a different room at onset of second stage.</li>
        <li>Guided expulsive efforts/sustained bearing down efforts.</li>
    </ul>
    So today, women are supposed to have the &#8216;right&#8217; to a safe birth, a
    right to health care, but not a right to the integrity of their bodies, food, or
    a right to employment for herself or her husband. Whose rights are being guaranteed?
    Those of the millions of &#8216;professionals&#8217; engaged in the growth industry
    of poverty alleviation and development. A World Health Organization report on women&#8217;s
    rights to safe motherhood errs in the first paragraph.
    <blockquote>
        This report considers how human rights laws can be applied to relieve the estimated
        1,400 deaths worldwide that occur every day, an annual mortality rate of 515,000,
        that women suffer because they are pregnant.<sup><a href="#73">73</a></sup></blockquote>
    Women don&#8217;t suffer and die because they are pregnant, but because they are
    impoverished, malnourished and overworked. As Arundhati Roy eloquently stated in
    her acceptance of the Sydney Peace Prize
    <blockquote>
        Today, it is not merely justice itself, but the idea of justice that is under attack.
        The assault on vulnerable, fragile sections of society is at once so complete, so
        cruel and so clever&#8212;all encompassing and yet specifically targeted&#8230;that
        its sheer audacity has eroded our definition of justice&#8230;.notions of equality,
        or parity have been pried loose and eased out of the equation&#8230;Almost unconsciously,
        we begin to think of justice for the rich and human rights for the poor. Justice
        for the corporate world, human rights for its victims&#8230;<sup><a href="#74">74</a></sup></blockquote>
    Jo Murphy-Lawless, one of the most articulate analysts of birth, sensitive to global
    politics, writes of the high tech, medical solutions proposed to solve the impoverished
    world&#8217;s problem of maternal mortality.
    <blockquote>
        Proposed solutions to problems of maternal mortality have flowed from advanced economies
        and global institutions like the World Health Organisation and have tended to reflect
        models of health care that are heavily influenced by the politico-administrative
        apparatus of the wealthy modern industrial/post-industrial state.&#8230;. In the
        World Health Organisation, whose professional core is made up of medical doctors,
        the issue of appropriate maternal policies and model-building for Safe Motherhood
        programmes, has been caught between the structures and systems in wealthy countries
        that produce their medical elite and the circumstances of poor countries, where
        maternal health and well-being are threatened by the problems of extreme poverty.<sup><a
            href="#75">75</a></sup></blockquote>
    It is within this context, then, that this collection of papers puts forward alternative
    visions of birth across class and globally: singing the female body, homebirth by
    an upper-class woman, Ayurveda, the birth knowledge of slum residents, cord cutters
    in Uttar Pradesh, a call for monetary recompense for <em>dais </em>and tracking
    the takeovers of birth from women. In the best of all worlds middle and upperclass
    women could learn the simple and natural methods of the dais for facilitating labour
    and handling postpartum. Their health would be positively impacted, medical professionals
    and facilities would be freed as backup for dais, for use by lower class women facing
    emergencies. Any midwife conducting a homebirth in the USA or Europe, or anywhere
    in the world, wants biomedical backup&#8212;so do <em>dais</em>.
    <br />
    <br />
    Murphy-Lawless points to the difficulty in transferring resource-intensive technological
    and pharmaceutical based models in increasingly unsecured social and economic conditions.
    She questions their applicability amid the increasingly extreme conditions created
    by the impact of globalisation on poor countries. She also asserts the violence
    behind the erasure of indigenous birth practices and practitioners in the Bolivian
    context.
    <blockquote>
        More critically still for women in Bolivia, the WHO has taken a particular stance
        on the issue of skilled attendance in childbirth. In 1992, the WHO drew a line under
        indigenous midwifery, categorising it as an unsafe traditional form which must be
        replaced with a full modern health care system (WHO, 1992). Leaving aside this policy
        as a violation of indigenous rights, it was a potentially disastrous decision from
        a practical point of view, given the still large percentages of women in parts of
        the world who give birth reliant on local indigenous midwifery and who do not have
        access to formal health care systems&#8230;</blockquote>
    It is my hope that the papers in this volume will alert readers to cultural resources,
    support networks, knowleges, and visions of how the world has been, and might be
    born. Perhaps we can appreciate and revitalize, selectively and critically, some
    of the birth and body culture, the women&#8217;s culture elaborated upon here. Veils
    of sharam, time, class, gender and caste have shrouded them from our gaze. These
    ways of birth are fast disappearing. Might the veil be lifted?
