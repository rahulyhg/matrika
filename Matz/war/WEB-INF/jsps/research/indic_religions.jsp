        On Understanding the Sacred in Dais&#8217; Handling of Birth

    <h3>
        Introduction</h3>
    This utterance, by a Mazbi Sikh dai in a MATRIKA workshop with 24 dais held in Fategarh
    Sahib Gurdwara provides an entry point for investigation of the sacred in these
    mainly low and outcaste women&#8217;s birth work, ritual and beliefs&#8212;and the
    three are an inseparable whole. This holism is as incomprehensible to the bio-medical
    health establishment as it is to priests, mullahs, pundits and others functionaries
    of &#8216;religious&#8217; authorities. Actually the rupture of healing and spirituality,
    of the doctors and the priests, a product of modernity is even displayed in the
    offerings at this conference. How can we represent Indic religions, without reference
    to its thousands if not millions of dais, malish wallahs, herbalists, ojahs, pirs,
    hakims, vaidyas, etc and their religious and indigenous medical practice?
    <br />
    <br />
    MATRIKA (Motherhood and Traditional Resources, Information, Knowledge, and Action)
    was a 3-year participatory action research project in collaboration with four local
    NGOs. MATRIKA is named after a group of female figures, usually either seven or
    eight, depicted in sculpture and myth as collective and semi-divine beings&#8212;and
    associated with mothering. The Matrika ../images include voluptuous beauties&#8212;one
    with an infant, theriomorphic (human body with animal head) figures and a wizened
    crone (for more detail see Panniker, 1997).
    <br />
    <br />
    We collaborated with grassroots based NGOs: Action India (working in the slums of
    Delhi); Mahila Jagriti Kendra (South Bihar); Voluntary Health Association of Punjab
    (Fategarh District) and URMUL (Rajasthan). The NGO called together dais who were
    considered by local women to be experienced and knowledgeable for a series of three
    workshops. In these workshops we posed the question &#8216;what does a woman need
    during pregnancy, birth and postpartum?&#8217;<br />
    The attitudes of our team members were crucial to the success of the research work.
    We consciously cultivated an ethos in which we were open to religio-cultural ways
    of thinking and doing &#8216;health&#8217; and assumed that these poor, illiterate,
    low caste women were the inheritors of India&#8217;s midwifery traditions.
    <br />
    <br />
    Our activities included role-plays, ritual drawings, body mapping, singing of birth
    songs, sharing of birth experiences (ours and theirs) as well as dais&#8217; life
    narratives. . Group discussions, interpreting role-plays and other data, were at
    the heart of our activities. We were able to access, and remain with, this alien
    (to us) information because we did not limit ourselves by separating data into mutually
    exclusive categories of &#8216;medicine&#8217; and &#8216;religion&#8217;. Rather
    we were receptive to diverse ways of facilitating birth, diagnosing and healing&#8212;to
    ritual enactments, notions of deities and demons, bhut-pret (ghosts and spirits)
    and the nazar or evil eye. We attempted to let the data speak the categories rather
    than the categories shape the data. This paper is drawn from that data
    <br />
    <br />
    In this paper we are not just demolishing the line between the sacred and the profane,
    between the pure and the impure, between swarg and narak&#8212;rather we are asserting
    the lived sacrality inherent in beliefs about and rituals accompanying women&#8217;s
    biological processes--menstruation and childbirth.<br />
    <h3>
        Context</h3>
    Ritual is belief in practice. It is very tempting for us modern women to stand outside
    of ideas of the &#8216;dirty&#8217; female body and critique the &#8216;confinement&#8217;
    of women at the time of menstruation and birth as archaic and misogynist. Having
    listened carefully to dais&#8217; voices, and paid attention to Indian and sub-continental
    representation systems for almost 30 years I am now adamantly against doing so.
    The project of modernity has displaced valuable indigenous resources, &#8216;cultural
    capital&#8217;
    <br />
    <br />
    Most of us are aware of the critical evaluation and devaluation by the Arya Samaj
    of household ritual and devotional puja in their return to the &#8216;original&#8217;
    and &#8216;pure&#8217; Vedic Hinduism. Their re-scripting of hymns expunged passion
    and metaphors of the body. Dualistic, god- disembodied and devotee as well. In this
    theology &#8216;aap&#8217; rather than &#8216;Tu&#8221; were used to address the
    divine
    <br />
    <br />
    Likewise the Brahmo Samaj did away with ritualism, in weddings the calash was banished
    along with the saptapadi, seven steps. Of course Tantric and Shaktic rites and beliefs
    were also &#8216;impure&#8217;. Both movements valorized the rational, scientific
    temper and drew from urban upper castes and classes. And furthered the chasm between
    co-religionists&#8212;fragmenting common religiosities. But few are aware of the
    negative impact that this &#8216;progressive&#8217; ideology had on women&#8217;s
    bodily observances, beliefs and rituals.<br />
    <h3>
        Displaced Ontologies and Epistomologies<br />
        The sacred other, sacred nature and the ontology of &#8216;inanimate objects&#8217;</h3>
    <em>Dai Ma, Dharti Ma</em><br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        <em>Dai pyar se samjhati hai<br />
            Sahalati hai aur sambhalti hai.<br />
            Ghanton jachche ke paas rahti hai<br />
            Dai jachche aur bachche ko sahara deti hai
            <br />
            Jaise Dharti humko sahara deti hai</em><br />
        <br />
        <em>O! Mother Dai you are like the Earth<br />
            You care for us, understand us.<br />
            You sit with us for hours and support us<br />
            Just like the earth gives us support.</em></p>
    <br />
    Similarly we find this ontological perspective in the theology of Bemata, the divine,
    and sometimes demonic, figure traditionally invoked by dais at the time of birth.<br />
    <br />
    <em>Bemata</em> is not like Durga or Saraswati, Lakshmi or even Santoshi Ma. To
    my knowledge there exist no temples, pilgrimage sites, texts, icons relating to
    Bemata, nor does she have a place in the ritual calendar. She cannot even be said
    to be aniconic&#8212;found in the form of a stone or a cave. If she represents anything,
    it is female reproductive physiology. As mentioned above she manifests as both a
    creative and a destructive force&#8212;procreativity while growing the baby, and
    pathology if she does not leave when her work is done.<br />
    <br />
    I first encountered Bemata 15 years ago in a collaborative research project with
    NGOs documenting women&#8217;s experiences of childbearing. In these interviews,
    conducted by health workers who were themselves <em>basti</em> residents, women
    spoke of Bemata as she was invoked during a ritual I call &#8220;the cutting of
    the <em>atta</em>&#8221;. Moti<em> Dai</em> describes the rite invoking Bemata emphasizing
    that the <em>dai</em>, herself, is empowered by <em>Bemata</em>.
    <br />
    <br />
    There is the custom of cutting the<em> atta</em> or rice. When the labour pains
    have come and the dai has arrived, the jachcha puts both hands full of <em>atta</em>
    in the <em>thali</em>. The dai holds the wrist of the mother while she, with her
    hand, separates the atta into two parts from the middle. Bemata is worshipped by
    putting money and gur on top of the <em>atta</em>, offering it to the dai, and saying
    &#8220;In this way separate the mother and the child so that the child is born without
    any difficulty.&#8221; It is said that when Ram and Lakshman were born Bemata herself
    came and acted as <em>dai</em>. Now it&#8217;s the dai, herself, who represents
    the shakti of Bemata. (Moti<em> Dai</em>&#8212;an upper caste midwife)<br />
    <br />
    Moti <em>Dai</em>, a rare high caste midwife, connects the ritual with the midwife
    who assisted Sita at Ram and Lakshman&#8217;s births. Shakina<em> Dai,</em> a Muslim
    midwife, mentions offerings to <em>Sayyid</em>, an Islamic figure, but similarly
    invokes Bemata. She also refers to the labouring woman as having one foot in heaven
    and the other in <em>narak</em> or hell.<br />
    <br />
    Look, sister, at the time of birth it&#8217;s only the woman&#8217;s <em>Shakti</em>.
    She who gives birth, at that time, her one foot is in heaven and the other, in hell.
    The woman&#8217;s <em>Shakti</em> is indeed a lot when she gives birth to a child.
    Before doing a delivery I.get the woman to open all the trunks, doors and so on.
    I pray to the One Above to open the knot quickly. I take off the sari, open the
    hair and take off the bangles or any jewellery. I put the <em>atta</em> on a <em>thali</em>
    and ask the woman to divide it into two equal parts. Also I get Rs.1.25 in the name
    of <em>Sayyid</em> kept separately. But mostly I remember Bemata. Repeatedly I pray
    to the <em>Bemata</em> &#8220;Oh mother! please open the knot quickly.&#8221; (<em>Shakina
        Dai</em>&#8212;a Muslim midwife)
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Dais</em> from all religions have invoked Bemata. In workshops in the Punjab,
    Mazbi (outcaste) <em>Sikh dais</em> said that they, too, pray to Bemata.
    <br />
    <br />
    In our first MATRIKA workshop with <em>dais</em> from Delhi slums we were told:<br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        <em>Bemata</em> is an old woman, has white hair and walks with the help of a stick.
        She stays under the earth and makes <em>putle</em> (puppets) and gives them to people.
        She gives to some people and does not give to others. When a baby smiles, it is
        believed that <em>Bemata</em> is making her smile.</p>
    <br />
    Imaged as a playful and rather fickle old woman, Bemata is amazingly familiar and
    at the same time a divine persona. She is invoked at the time of childbirth being
    the special patron of dais and parturient women. Living underground, she creates
    human beings out of earth, breathing life into them and writes their fate on their
    foreheads shortly after birth. Bemata is immanent in all nature, grows and protects
    the baby in the womb, but also seems to be responsible for complications if she
    does not &#8216;exit&#8217; the mother&#8217;s body via postpartum bleeding. She
    is understood to leave the birth home at the time of the Chatti rite, six days after
    birth when she is thanked for growing and protecting the baby. However, she is also
    perceived as being responsible for diseases of mother and child in the postpartum
    period. Theologically, it is important to note that the presence of the same force
    that is seen as benign and fecund at one time (pregnancy and birth) becomes destructive
    and dangerous at another (post birth) if she is not in the process of diminishing
    or leaving. Thus the divine/demonic valence of Bemata is entirely contextual and
    time-dependent.
    <br />
    <br />
    These kinds of conflations, were de-ligitimized by the rationalist, scientific mindset
    and the disembodied religiosity propounded by the modernists.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>The conflation of the female body and the earth&#8212;Reclaiming narak</strong><br />
    <br />
    <strong><em>Narak Quotes<br />
    </em></strong>The following data from our workshop transcripts present meanings
    of narak. These quotes from Bihar speak explicitly, using the word &#8216;narak.&#8217;
    In other areas the meanings are more implicit in the practices and the &#8216;dirtiness&#8217;
    associated with times of female fertility.<br />
    <br />
    Girls are considered holy before puberty. The marriage of a young girl, who has
    not had her periods, is performed with her sitting on her father&#8217;s lap. After
    puberty the woman is considered unclean, and is unholy, because she bleeds, and
    this is <em>narak</em>.<br />
    <br />
    On <em>Chhati</em> day the narak period ends. The<em> Dai</em> checks if the umbilical
    cord has fallen off. Then she bathes the baby and beats a<em> thaali</em> (plate).
    After this the woman is bathed and wears new clothes. The <em>dai</em> cleans the
    room where the delivery took place and the woman was kept separately for six days.
    The dirty clothes of mother and child are washed. After this the <em>dai</em> is
    given soap and oil for bathing. All this is on the sixth day after delivery.
    <br />
    <br />
    Although often translated as hellish or demonic place, <em>narak</em> can be understood
    as the site or energy of the unseen inner world - of the earth and of the body,
    particularly the fertile and bleeding female body. <em>Narak</em> has the connotation
    &#8216;filth&#8217; but also signifies the fertility or fruitful potential of the
    earth and woman. So-called &#8216;pollution taboos&#8217; are related to <em>narak</em>&#8212;where
    the idea of the sacred is radically separated from the reproductive potential of
    the female body. During menstruation and post-birth women are &#8216;unclean&#8217;.
    However the dai speaks with a very different voice than the pundit about this uncleanness,
    this <em>narak</em>. To her the placenta, the ultimate polluting substance in the
    <em>shastra</em> literature, is spoken of reverently. It is no coincidence that
    <em>dais</em> are mainly from low and outcaste communities. Both caste and gender
    are involved in concepts of narak.
    <br />
    <br />
    Despite the pejorative connotations of the word<em> narak</em>, the concept has
    allowed for abiding female spaces and birth cultures. In the &#8216;male&#8217;
    or &#8216;dominant&#8217; view these female times are &#8216;filthy&#8217; or polluted,
    but they are also times when masculine, social and even familial demands on women
    are suspended. And traditionally older women guarded these spaces from any incursions&#8212;perhaps
    with the help of &#8216;demons&#8217; and nether forces!? Within this imagistic
    representation, the nature of female bodily energy is understood as &#8216;out of
    control&#8217;&#8212;women are presumed to be more emotional and have special physical
    needs at this time&#8212;so the usual social constraints are suspended. Of course
    we need to interrogate the priestly voice and de-sacralisation of menstruation and
    birth&#8212;but we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater. We should not
    ignore the traditional birth knowledge of India.<br />
    <br />
    Conversely the fertility of land and woman are acknowledged and honored. Both are
    &#8216;fruitful&#8217; and this is not simply a symbolic device. Within indigenous
    medical traditions such as Ayurveda, and with the dais, a totally different ontological
    system is at work. Woman is not a &#8216;symbol&#8217; of the earth. Nor is the
    earth a &#8216;symbol&#8217; of woman. Rather they both partake of the same nature
    of fecundity. Just as the wind outside my window partakes of the same essence as
    the breath which flows in and out of my lungs.<br />
    <br />
    During <em>narak</em> time what is usually closed, the womb, is open, raw, vulnerable
    and bleeding. <em>Narak</em> allows for the imaging of the unseen&#8212;and the
    use of other senses, besides the visual, as well as the human capacities of empathy
    and imagination in diagnostics and therapeutics. And in fact <em>narak</em> is deeply
    implicated in the handling of postpartum care.
    <br />
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        After delivery a woman is not given any grain or heavy food. This is called<em> narak</em>
        fasting. Grain is only given on the third day after all the dirty blood comes out.
        On first day, she eats biscuits with tea. She drinks warm water. Second day, heat-producing
        balls made out of ginger, pepper, turmeric, roasted rice, milk and jaggery (<em>saunth
            laddos</em>). On the third day, rice, dal and vegetables. (Bihar)<br />
        It is called dirty blood because it has collected over nine months in the body.
        It is dark, smelly and clotted. It comes out first and then fresh clean blood comes
        out.
        <br />
        <br />
        With a little pressure and massage we take it out completely, and when the color
        of the blood becomes clear like monthly cycle we believe that it is clean. (Punjab)<br />
        <em>Gola </em>is baby's home. When the house becomes empty, only dirty blood is
        left. When this comes out there is pain. Hot drinks (of <em>ajwain</em>, <em>saunth</em>,
        <em>pipar</em> and<em> gur</em>) are given. This drink cleans the belly. After the
        baby is born, the gola roams around. This <em>gola</em> has taken care of the baby,
        now it must leave. If the pain is intense then warm fomentation is done and gola
        melts away (<em>pighal jata hai</em>). This is dirty blood and needs cleaning up.
        (Delhi)</p>
    <br />
    Perhaps in the dominant world religions (Judeo-Christian-Islamic and Hinduism, or
    more correctly Brahminism) the concept of<em> narak</em> or &#8216;hell&#8217; overlays
    previous meaning systems which<br />
    <br />
    Concepts of &#8216;pollution taboo&#8217; mask sophisticated bodily praxis involving
    parturient women. Isolation postpartum and during menses allows a woman to withdraw
    her attention from the everyday world and its demands into the experience of female
    physiological functioning, thus providing not only rest but also a kind of meditation
    on body cosmos connections. Interestingly these changes are understood to produce
    a cleansing &#8216;heat&#8217; within the body, akin to the yogic tapasya.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
        Dais&#8217; work as &#8216;Sewa ka Kam&#8217;</h3>
    Dais with whom MATRIKA interacted spoke of their work attending births as &#8216;sewa
    ka kam.&#8217; Inserted within its own religio-cultural and indigenous medical,
    as well as socio-economic context the work of birth is one of service. As one dai
    said to us &#8220;How can I not come to the side of a woman who is giving birth
    just because she is poor?&#8221; Another spoke of using her own oil and actually
    giving money to a new mother totally without resources. Subhadra Rai elaborates
    this orientation towards dai work.<br />
    <br />
    Dais&#8217; own perceptions of their care work are couched in socio-cultural terms
    of<em> poonya ka kaam</em> (good work), <em>dharm</em> (duty, religion), blessings,
    happiness, help the poor, and reciprocity. These terms take precedence over other
    valuations of their work. It is not that monetary payment is unimportant or secondary,
    but contextualising their work within the sociocultural framework becomes easier
    in the society in which they operate.<br />
    <br />
    The ritual practice, conflations of female body and earth, dai ma and dharti ma,
    as well as notions of narak as embodied female experience all allow us to reconfigure
    the conventional notions of female &#8216;impurity. The dai, and traditional women&#8217;s
    bodily praxis during menses and postpartum express a poetics and sacrality of the
    body foreign to the modern, scientific and &#8216;rational&#8217; mind, as well
    as the Brahmanic and textual orientation of &#8216;Hinduism&#8217;. Unfortunately
    displacement of these religio-cultural practices and beliefs has abdicated definitions
    of the procreative female body to the pollution of the priests and the pathology
    of the bio-medical practitioners. We are all bereft of positive imagery, the hands
    on care-taking and location in the cosmic play of creativity and generativity which
    has marked women&#8217;s ritual performances and the beliefs they celebrate.<br />
