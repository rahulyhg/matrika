        Location</p>
    <p class="default">
        Gomia is a small industrial town located in South Bihar. This part of Bihar is rich
        in mineral resources like coal, iron ore and mica therefore it is also one of the
        most industrialized regions of the country. In spite of industrialization and rich
        resources it is still considered one of the most backward regions of the country.
        Ranchi and Dhanbad are adjacent towns of Gomia, the nearest railway station being
        Gomo. Coma station is mainly for goods trains, carrying coal and iron from Bihar
        to other areas. Dhanbad is a big station and is well connected to Delhi. The Matrika
        team visited Gomia via Dhanbad. From Dhanbad station we took a taxi till Gomia.
        This journey by road was tiring as the roads were kacha - with potholes and ditches.
        It takes around an hour and a half to reach Gomia, which is barely 50 kilometers
        away.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        An important landmark in Gomia town is the IEL (Indian Explosives Limited) gate.
        This is the entrance to the explosives factory. One can see many workers going in
        and out of this gate on their bicycles. Outside the gate there are a few dhabas
        that serve tea, snacks and meals. From here, Mahila Jagriti Center, the base of
        the NGO with whom we worked, is 5 kilometers away. In the region around Gomia one
        can feel the air pollution from industries and power generating stations.
    </p>
    <p class="lrgtxt2">
        Industrial Employees</p>
    <p class="default">
        Gomia is located in the coal mine belt and houses the Indian Explosives Limited
        (IEL) and the Central Coal India Limited (CCL). Most of the workers employed by
        these companies are migrants from North Bihar. The workers get several facilities
        &#8211; company quarters with water and electricity, medical facilities such as
        hospitals, doctors and medicines and a regular salary. Employees have financial
        security. Gomia town is a typical industrial town - the basic modern amenities for
        workers&#8217; well being are available. Besides a regular salary, there are pension
        and retirement schemes, loan and education facilities, which are provided by the
        companies. A reflection of this monetarised lifestyle can be seen in the towns markets.
        There are huge automobile shops and shops selling confectionery, Coke and Pepsi,
        electronics and cosmetics.
    </p>
    <p class="lrgtxt2">
        Basti living conditions</p>
    <p class="default">
        In the midst of the township are the bastis of the traditional inhabitants of this
        region &#8211; <em>Chamars</em> (<em>Harijans</em>) and <em>Dushads</em> (<em>Ravidas</em>).
        The <i>dais</i> are either Ravidas or from Harijan castes. These caste groups are
        poor, live in mud houses with brick tiles (<em>khapra</em>) and own no land. Many
        of them survive by serving other higher caste groups as landless laborers. Women
        serve as <i>dais</i> for their respective landlord families. Both men and women
        work on their landlord&#8217;s fields and have a patron client bond called the <i>jajmani</i>
        system.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Caste boundaries are very strong. A relationship of separation and distance on the
        basis of clean and unclean caste and occupation exists. For instance, lower castes
        are considered to be permanently unclean and are therefore assigned low and dirty
        jobs. <i>dais</i> are not allowed to enter their landlords&#8217; kitchens. The
        lower groups live in separate localities away from the upper castes -- physical
        distance is always maintained.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Some men earn an income by selling coal to petty contractors. They pick up coal
        from the mines, an illegal occupation as the mines are government property, burn
        coal, make it pukka (stronger) and then sell it to town dwellers or to contractors.
        Every day they pick up 10-15 kilos of raw coal from the mines. There is a clandestine
        understanding between the mine security personnel, the picker and the contractor.
        This illegal occupation is an accepted mode of earning a living. There is nothing
        hidden about it.
    </p>
    <p class="lrgtxt2">
        Land</p>
    <p class="default">
        Only one fourth of total land is cultivable. The land is arid and barren. There
        is an acute shortage of water. River water is the only source of water and is used
        for all purposes - drinking, washing and bathing (well/water pumps dry up because
        of low-water levels). The town folk do not face any water shortage. It is only the
        poor basti people who have no water.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        A large portion of cultivable land is owned by powerful middle caste groups, referred
        as Other Backward Classes -- powerful as they own land &#8211; <em>Yadavs, Telis and
            Kumhars</em>. These caste groups live in separate localities. They have pukka,
        brick houses and keep livestock - cows and buffaloes - at home. Many also manage
        to acquire work in the factory.
    </p>
    <p class="lrgtxt2">
        Tribal Inhabitants</p>
    <p class="default">
        There are also tribal people living in this area. The <i>Santhalis </i>, the largest
        tribal group were the original inhabitants. Amongst them there was no concept of
        individual ownership. The community owned Land, water, forest. Any hierarchy was
        based on age and sex. They had a strong &#8220;We&#8221; feeling. These tribals
        got displaced when factories were built, forests were destroyed and land was taken
        over. He factories attracted many outsiders&#8212;referred to as dikus, a tribal
        derogatory term for intruders. The tribals were displaced by the Government in the
        name of development of &#8216;backward&#8217; regions. Migrant caste groups called
        them &#8216;<i>junglee</i>&#8217;. The tribal people lost their land, forest, water
        and their culture. They could not fit into the new industrialized economy and the
        modern way of living and became alienated. The development of the area did not benefit
        these original inhabitants. In fact, they are left with no land or work and are
        lost.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Some tribal people have started working as agricultural laborers or as <i>beldars </i>
        (construction workers). In the local language this is referred to as <i>hajri</i>.
        But employment is not available all the time. Some earn a living by petty coal business.
        The <i>Santhalis </i>always kept livestock and now too they keep a few goats, hens
        and pigs. They also brew rice beer. Traditionally it was brewed for personal consumption
        but now they also sell it.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The <i>Santhalis </i>are a closed group, the modern interventions and exploitation
        by outsiders has made them suspicious. They are skeptical about any change. Mahila
        Jagriti health workers faced many problems interacting with <em>Santhali </em>women.
        Their men-folk were afraid that they would be converted into Christianity and modernized.
        They had already lost their own religion (worship of <i>Singh Bonga </i>&#8211;
        a special stone, a form of nature worship) and were now incorporated at the lowest
        rung of caste system. They have more faith in their traditional <em>Ojhas, Gunis</em>
        (Shamans, healers who use <em>jari-booti</em>) and can relate to them and not to
        the modern capsules of iron and injections. However there are no <i>dais</i><strong>
        </strong>amongst them. They call <i>dais</i> from outside. <i>dai</i> work is considered
        low and dirty. This attitude was probably adopted as a result of the outsider caste
        influence.</p>
    <p class="lrgtxt2">
        Food
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Eating habits have changed, according to the <i>dais</i>. They say that the younger
        generation prefers to eat peas, chholey and <em>besan ka sabji</em>. Whereas the
        older generation laid more emphasis on green leafy vegetables like drumstick and
        <em>mahua leaves</em> which were easily available. The present generation prefers
        potatoes, lady&#8217;s finger, brinjal and tomatoes. All these vegetables are bought
        from the weekly market. The Matrika team visited the weekly <em>haat</em> or bazaar,
        spread over a huge field. There were petty banias selling huge heaps of potatoes
        and onions. This seemed to be the staple vegetable diet. The local people from the
        surrounding villages had small heaps of green vegetables like spinach, cabbage and
        bitter gourd, which were from their own fields. The other shops were selling rice
        and lentils, earthen pots and aluminum utensils, bamboo baskets as well as cosmetics.
        Both the basti people and the factory workers came to these weekly <em>haats</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        However, when we interacted with the <i>dais</i>, and discussed the common diets
        of poor pregnant women, the extent of shortage of food, hunger and malnutrition
        became apparent. The sister-in-law of one of the Mahila Jagriti Kendra workers had
        died shortly after childbirth and we learned that her diet during pregnancy consisted
        mainly of rice and salt. Older <i>dais</i> reported that they and their families
        used to rely on drumsticks growing either wild or in their compound and gather greens
        from common areas to supplement their diets. But with the increased development
        of the area this resource was no longer available to them.</p>
    <p class="lrgtxt2">
        Medical Shops</p>
    <p class="default">
        Many medical shops have sprung up and Rural Medical Practitioners and Compounders
        (all men) have become important players in health delivery systems. Use of sui-goli
        medicine has flourished. Even traditionally trained <i>dais</i> are being forced
        to use syntocin injections as families demand quick delivery. Family members, the
        <i>dais</i> say, are not prepared to wait. For giving injections the local R.M.P
        is called and is given 100 rupees or more. The <i>dai</i> who does everything is
        rarely paid more than 50 rupees.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        <i>dais</i> said that in difficult cases women are mostly taken to Hazaribagh Mission
        Hospital which is 50-60 kilometers from Gomia. Families trust the treatment given
        at the Mission hospital rather than the hospital at Gomia town. Affordability and
        access/money for transport make this an option of last resort.</p>
    <p class="lrgtxt2">
        Modernization</p>
    <p class="default">
        Modernization has led to many problems. The worst affected are the women from lower
        castes. Women walk long distances of 8 to10 km to find work as the town has spread.
        Buses are expensive, they charge 3-4 rupees and this they cannot afford. They do
        all the household chores besides working as agricultural laborers. There is no space/forest
        left even for defecation. The influence of modernization can be seen in the dress
        style. The <i>dais</i> wear synthetic saris as they are easier to wash and require
        no ironing. They are also cheap and durable. No one wears cotton saris anymore.
        They say, &#8220;We cannot afford it. Our mothers and grandmothers used to wear
        only cotton dhotis.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        <i>dais</i> are slowly losing their hold on traditional birth practices as the biomedical
        system is in vogue, although it is expensive. In this situation, <i>dais</i> are
        trying to save their work by accepting the demands of the new systems. Modernization
        has also given rise to a desire for education in the hope that it will give them
        employment. However, there are no government schools functioning. Children drop
        out of school after a few years. Boys who have acquired a little education are not
        prepared to take up labor work like selling coal or working at construction sites
        and there are no jobs in the factory. Many youths just sit idle and roam about.
        Some have become alcoholic. Families are facing problems with their unemployed youths.
    </p>
    <p class="lrgtxt2">
        <i>jajmani</i> System -Traditional Feudal System
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Serving castes occupy the lowest rung in the caste hierarchy. These are the <em>Chamar,
            Dushad</em> (both untouchables) <i>Kumhar, Lohar </i>etc. (backward castes).
        The patron-client relationship with upper caste neighbors to whom they provide their
        services is called <i>jajmani</i> system. It is a traditional division of labor
        based on caste hierarchies. The patron-client relationship is passed on from generation
        to generation. Neither can change allegiance. The lower castes have fixed clients
        (kisans). (The <i>jajman</i> is referred as <em>kisan</em> in the local language.)
        There is no free market. The lower castes work on their clients&#8217; fields and
        also do some household work (not cooking or cleaning utensils because they belong
        to unclean castes). The <i>dai</i> fits into the<em> <i>jajmani</i> </em>contract
        and has fixed kisans (<i>jajman</i>). This relationship is obligatory and not based
        on her proficiency.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Within the<i>jajmani</i> System, there is security of work and a distribution of
        labour. There is no conflict or competition in the market. For instance, if <em>Saubatia
        </em>(name of a <i>dai</i>) is ill and cannot attend on her <i>jajman</i>, she can
        send <em>Bhagwania</em> (another <i>dai</i>) for her kisan&#8217;s delivery because
        she is of the same family. A <i>jajman</i> cannot call anyone else on his own. Payment
        is in cash or kind.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The <i>dais</i> get money from their <i>jajman</i> during festivals or on special
        occasions. In fact whenever they visit the <i>jajman</i>&#8217;s house they get
        something -- food or grains or gifts. For example Bhagwania went to Khamra Basti
        to meet her <i>jajman</i> and she was given corn which the <i>jajman</i>s had got
        from their farm.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Today men are breaking away from <i>jajmani</i> bonds. But women are still working
        for <i>jajman</i>s, in fact they have also taken over some of the men&#8217;s work.
        Income from <i>jajmani</i> is not sufficient and families have to look for additional
        work in the open market. Farm work is available only for two months in a year. For
        each day they get 6 paila of paddy, equivalent to one and a half kilos of rice which
        amounts to 15-16 rupees. For construction work they get Rs.25 -30 per day and by
        selling coal they earn Rs.50 -100 per day.
    </p>
    <p class="lrgtxt">
        Festivals</p>
    <p class="default">
        Festivals give some respite to women from their drudgery. <i>Karma</i> is a major
        festival for celebrating the brother-sister bond. A<em> karam</em> tree is worshipped.
        Women sing and dance. Both tribals and lower caste groups celebrate <i>Karma</i>.
        Jitya is observed for the well being of sons and <em>Teej</em> for the husband.
        Women fast on these days. All caste groups celebrate these.
    </p>
    <p class="lrgtxt">
        MAHILA JAGRITI KENDRA
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Mahila Jagriti Kendra has worked with women for eight years and is affiliated with
        the Bihar Mahila Samakhya program (state-funded) for women&#8217;s education and
        empowerment. MJK have decided to extend the scope of their activities to include
        women&#8217;s health. Their initiatives include training in herbal medicine for
        their workers, reproductive health workshops and our Matrika workshops. The organizers
        have relied on our workshops to reach out to the local <i>dais</i> and are planning
        to open small health facilities in remote areas. Our interactions with their grassroots
        workers have oriented them on pregnancy and birth and enabled them to establish
        working relationships with the <i>dais</i>.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The health workers got inputs from Shodhini on the usage of herbs, like treating
        white discharge by using garlic or neem leaf. They make tonics out of <em>amla</em>,
        hibiscus flowers, <em>mahua</em> and drumstick leaves. They also go for special
        training to learn to recognize some herbs that are found in forests.
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        Mahila Jagriti originally organized on the issue of violence against women. This
        violence is very high and is often related to demands for dowry or second marriages
        for dowry. MJK workers visit the women&#8217;s families and the <em>panchayat </em>
        and try to sort out the situations in which women are experiencing violence. In
        serious cases they even go to the police station and the courts. In many cases they
        have managed to get compensation for the aggrieved woman. They also participate
        in <em>dharnas</em> or procession on social issues. We heard of an instance when
        the colliery hospital at Gomia sent a woman to Bokaro Steel City hospital. The woman
        died there and the Bokaro hospital said that the drip being used in Gomia was just
        plain water. A huge dharna was organized against the colliery hospital authorities.
        Mahila Jagriti women participated in it. They are daring and forthright and are
        often leaders of the community struggles for justice for women.
    </p>
    <p class="lrgtxt2">
        Framework of the NGO</p>
    <p class="default">
        There is no clear division of function between Mahila Jagriti and Mahila Samakhya.
        Both groups are involved in each other&#8217;s work. Each division is funded by
        separate sources.<br />
        Health workers (<em>Sahayoginis</em>) work very hard and walk to their area which
        is very far and takes minimum one hour. They visit their areas five days a week
        and once a week they have a joint meeting. They work diligently under difficult
        circumstances. Each worker has a lot of responsibility. However, the health workers
        do not seem to express personal opinions on the running of the organization, for
        instance, on the method/system of working and the positive/ negative points of the
        organization. It seems that the organization has not developed this kind of participatory
        decision making work ethic. The work probably is dictated or directed from above.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The <em>Sahayoginis</em> share a cordial working relationship with their colleagues.
        They never criticize their co-workers&#8217; performance or pass negative comments.
        They respect Pilar for her work and therefore never question her decisions.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The<em> Sahayoginis</em> however do voice the opinion that their salaries should
        be hiked because of increasing price rises. However they have no option but to carry
        on as there are no other jobs available and for many this is the only source of
        income. They had problems with Pilar being strict regarding extra expenses on food
        or lodging. But their opinion changed after reviewing the books along with the auditor.
        He praised the NGO for running such an extensive project on such a low budget. They
        realized that money was being spent wisely and economically.</p>
    <p class="default">
        The overwhelming problem of running an NGO in such an impoverished area, where legal
        livelihood sources are virtually non-existent, is that money and other resources
        are always issues of contention and possible divisiveness. Matrika wanted to recompense
        the <i>dais</i> for transport to our workshops but Pilar resisted this as the last
        time she had tried it women fought with each other for weeks over who came from
        how far and how much they got for it. Matrika had to respect the NGO decision on
        this matter because solidarity for the NGO is an important consideration&#8212;and
        this means avoiding potential conflict situations.</p>
    <p class="lrgtxt2">
        Samooh Meetings
    </p>
    <p class="default">
        The <em>Sahayoginis</em> conduct samooh meetings every week in their specified villages.
        Women are somehow reluctant to talk about birth practices and are interested only
        in family planning. Elderly women say that, &#8220;We cannot talk about it in front
        of our bahus.&#8221; People call the <em>Sahayoginis randis </em>(prostitutes) as
        they discuss their bodies and the birth process in public. It is a major challenge
        for the <em>Sahayoginis</em>.</p>
    <p class="default">
        Besides women, men folk are a major obstacle. Women always say that if men hear
        that we talk of birth they would not allow us to attend these meetings. Some educated
        men of the <em>bastis</em> questioned the <em>Sahayoginis</em>, and asked for their
        identity cards and their organization&#8217;s cards. These men do petty politics
        in the bastis. <em>Basti</em> men listen to these small time politicians and stop
        their women from attending meetings.</p>
