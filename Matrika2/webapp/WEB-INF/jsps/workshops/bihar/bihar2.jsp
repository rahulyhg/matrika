                            hand, hold the cord, and pull it out. In one case when the placenta was stuck inside
                            for 12 hours, the woman died. In another case, placenta and cord were out but baby
                            not delivered, so the doctor was called, injection given to induce contractions,
                            and then the baby delivered.</li>

                            got pushed further in. The <i>dai</i> reports that she opened the woman&apos;s legs,
                            slowly put in her hand and managed to take out the placenta.</li>

                            a small pouch dipped in mustard oil and roasted <em>ajwain</em> into the vagina.
                            Also, the <i>dai</i> presses the woman&apos;s vaginal area with her heels, on which

                            In the village group meetings organised by MJK (Mahila Jagriti Kendra) and MS (Mahila
                            Samakhya) sahayoginis, village women have said -- &quot;You talk like prostitutes!&quot;
                            Village women have also said that if their men knew that there is all this talk
                            (about reproduction and childbirth), they would not allow them to attend these meetings.
                        </li>
                        <li class="default">During the session on Body Mapping, there were inhibitions, and
                            a lot of laughter when the local term for vagina (<em>burr</em>) was mentioned.</li>
                        <li class="default"><em>Kuan puja</em> (well worship) takes place generally on the third
                            day after childbirth. The <i>dai</i> (also called <em>maharain</em>) massages the
                            new mother with oil. She puts <em>sindwar </em>leaves in water and boils them, bathes
                            baby with this water. She presses a thread under the tongue so the baby&apos;s voice
                            is loud and clear, and presses the baby&apos;s lips and eyebrows. Saas and <em>nanad
                            </em>clean the room, nanad is given <em>neg</em>. After bath, the new mother touches
                            the feet of elders and ancestors. </li>
                        <li class="default">From childbirth up to <i>chhati</i> (usually on 6th day after birth,
                            could be 5 or 7 or 9 days) the new mother and new-born baby are believed to be in
                            `narak Kurd&apos;&apos; (literally, `vessel of hell&apos;; it is a period of pollution).
                            From birth upped <i>chhati</i>, the woman is not to touch anything else in the house.
                            The <i>dai</i> is her companion during these days. The new mother and baby are in
                            a separate room -- wherein the birth too had taken place -- and she is given food
                            there itself, on a leaf-plate. She is to do no housework. It is only after <i>chhati</i>
                            ceremonies are performed that the mother and child, and <i>dai</i>, and in fact
                            whole family, are redeemed from a state of pollution. </li>

                            day marks the closure of the period of `<em>narak Kurd</em>&apos;. On <i>chhati</i>,
                            the <i>dai</i> checks to see if the cord has fallen; bathes the baby; beats a <em>Thai
                            </em>(metal plate). The mother is bathed, both mother and baby wear new clothes.
                            The <i>dai</i> hands over the baby to the <em>devarani </em>(the mother&apos;s younger
                            sister-in-law), who does <em>namaskar </em>(respectful salutation by folding hands)
                            and then hands the baby to the <em>jethani</em> (elder sister-in-law). The <i>dai</i>
                            cleans the room, and she bathes. </span>

                                <li class="default">Before <i>chhati</i>, <em>sasural</em> (marital home) people visit
                                    the maika (natal home) people, and invite them by offering lota for `<em>samadhi milan</em>&apos;&apos;&apos;.
                                    The maika people come at <i>chhati</i> and are welcomed. When the maika people arrive,
                                    first a curtain is put between the two sets of parents (of the new-born&apos;s mother,
                                    and the new-born&apos;s father), the <em>sasural </em>people sprinkle water on the
                                    <em>maika </em>people, both sides give paan (betel leaves) to one another, feet
                                    are washed, beard shaved, and the <em>samadhis</em> (parents of the young couple,
                                    from both sides) embrace each other. There is <i>chhati</i> <em>bharna</em> -- the
                                    woman&apos;s mother (baby&apos;s <em>nani</em>) gives oil and new clothes for the
                                    new-born. She lights a <em>diya</em>, rice is kept in a plate, and arti is performed
                                    for the baby. Five children are fed <em>kheer</em>. The woman&apos;s mother also
                                    brings new clothes for her son-in-law and others. The woman herself (i.e. the new-born&apos;s
                                    mother) is adorned with <em>sindur</em> and <em>kajal</em>. Special foods are cooked.
                                    From this day, she can eat everything. The entire family, and <i>dai</i> eat together
                                    on <i>chhati</i> day. If the baby is a boy, food and books are kept for him; if
                                    it is a girl, utensils are kept. The <i>dai</i> takes leave the next day. The <em>saas</em>
                                    puts <em>sindur</em> and<em> kajal </em>for her, and gives her a new sari, rice,
                                    sometimes money. The <i>dai</i> should leave happy. It is believed that if the <i>dai</i>
                                    is happy, the baby too will be happy.</li>

                        <li><span class="default">The <i>dais</i> seem to share a wide cultural understanding
                            in which the upper part of the body is associated with `<em>swarg</em>&apos;&apos;
                            (heaven) and also with the upper castes; the middle part of the body is associated
                            with `<em>dharti&apos;</em> (earth) and also with the middle castes; and the lower

                            lower castes. The genital area is included in the lower part of the body. One <i>dai</i>
                            questioned this arrangement, by asking, during the workshop, &quot;The whole body
                            is one, then why is there this division, with one part considered untouchable?&quot;

                            <li class="default">The compounder (CB Sharma) when interviewed said he has done a diploma
                                in pharmacy, and works in his brother-in-law&apos;s chemist shop in Gomia. He goes
                                to homes and administers injections if prescribed by a doctor (to whom a <i>dai</i>
                                may have referred a case). For injections he uses disposable syringes. Each compounder
                                has a prescribed area. Sometimes the <i>dai</i> may come directly to him to ask
                                for pitocin or oxytocin injections if there is dilatation without labour pains:
                                then too he goes and administers an injection; sometimes he puts a drip too. An
                                injection is needed in 2% of cases, while 95% are normal deliveries; 2% deliveries
                                are conducted by private doctors and 1% taken to the hospital in Hazaribagh. CB
                                Sharma considers the rituals practiced by people, by <i>dais</i>, and by <i>ojhas </i>
                                or <i>majhis</i> to be useless and a waste of money. He says that after administering
                                pitocin birth takes place within 5 or 7 minutes; but in case the first dose is not
                                effective then after 3 hours a second dose is given. At times the compounder may

                                He says that people do not on the whole like to take injections. He is critical
                                of <i>dais</i>&#8217; work because he says women can get infected; but sees it as
                                necessary because not everybody can go to doctors.</li>
                            <li class="default">Sr. Mary, of the MJK Mission Hospital, notes that the private doctors
                                do not accept poor patients; they charge 600-700 per normal delivery. The compounder
                                CB Sharma said that &quot;Poor people are dying as your hospital is not taking delivery
                                cases.&quot; </li>

                                the Compounder) there is not much increase in sale. Increase in the number of shops
                                is more a consequence of unemployment.</li>

                                appropriate medical interventions. Doctors and other health professionals seem to
                                have a biased approach, they think the <i>dais</i>&#8217; methods are wrong, without

                            <li class="default">The <i>dais</i> of Gomia come across as situated at the lower end
                                of various power-arrangements -- in terms of caste, class as well as gender. </li>
                            <li class="default">In terms of <strong>caste</strong>, the <i>dais</i> are all `<em>Chamar</em>&apos;&apos;
                                (or <em>Ravidas</em>). Being a polluted caste, associations of pollution with the
                                work of midwifery get integrated into the overall understanding of <i>dais</i> as
                                untouchable. </li>
                            <li class="default">A <strong>caste-class</strong> nexus is at work here. In Gomia,
                                a feudal <em>jajmani</em> (patron-client) system is in operation. </li>
                            <li class="default">Over the past 3 or 4 months, one <i>dai</i>, <em>Razia</em>, had
                                performed 10 deliveries in the homes of kisans (literally, farmers -- landed middle-caste
                                -- her jajmans or patrons). Another <i>dai</i> Phoolkumari had conducted 2 deliveries
                                in the homes of gawalas (owners of milch cattle -- middle caste).</li>
                            <li class="default">The <i>dai</i> shares a low status alongwith other women, be they
                                high-caste or low-caste. However, through a game on <strong>gender</strong>, we
                                found that approximately half the participants would prefer to be a man in their
                                next birth. The reasons why they would prefer mailed indicate the down-side of their
                                experience of being women -- one said if she is a boy, she can play, have fun and
                                relax at home; others said women have to work too hard and moreover they are taken
                                for granted; oner said that she is tired of this life; the reason given by another
                                was that her husband had left her so in her next birth she would leave someone --
                                men can keep more than one wife; one participant expressed that as a man &quot;I
                                will be able to earn, will not get `married off&apos; [i.e. go at a young age into
                                a new, marital, household], and I will have a wife to press my feet!&quot;; another
                                commented that women have many health problems, and are not cared for by anyone.&quot;
                            </li>
                            <li class="default">However, approximately half the participants said they would like
                                to be reborn as females. The reasons given indicate, partly, a certain pride in
                                themselves<em> as women</em>. One said she would like to be a woman in her next
                                birth too because &quot;a woman makes a home, and ensures survival of the world&quot;;
                                another said the world is perpetuated by women, and if women have problems, so do
                                men; another said she would like to do something for the next generation of girls.
                                Others said -- they would prefer being reborn as women simply because that is what
                                they are right now; they will continue to have many problems which they will attempt
                                to solve; they would work on the land....</li>
                            <li class="default">Of course, <i>dais</i> are repositories of certain quintessentially
                                female knowledge -- the knowledge of the female body, and of childbirth. Thus, they
                                partake in a very special way of both the down-side and the up-side of the general
                                status of women. <i>dais</i> are women who know about womanhood -- about femaleness
                                -- in a more special way than do other women. In other words, <i>dais</i> in a unique
                                way embody in themselves both the<em> pollution and the power</em> that attaches
                                to womanhood.</li>
                            <li class="default"><i>dais</i> are highly respected at the time of birth, but at the
                                same time it is a period of untouchability so they, being caste-untouchables, can
                                be the companions of the mother, who, by nature of her birth-giving, is in a state
                                of <em>pollution</em>. Therefore the <i>dai</i>&apos;s status is full of contradictions.
                                At <i>chhati</i>, the <i>dai</i> is traditionally honoured by the family in which
                                the baby has been born. They put sindur on her, give her gifts and money. They want
                                her to be happy, and believe that the baby will be happy if the <i>dai</i> is happy.
                            </li>
                            <li class="default"><i>dais</i> customarily do not assist in the deliveries of their
                                own daughter-in-law. It is done by gotni or <em>devarani</em>, or a neighbouring
                                <i>dai</i>. Sometimes, rather than call in a neighbouring <i>dai</i> which will
                                mean an expense, the mother-in-law may do it herself. But it is considered a matter
                                of <em>sharam</em>.</li>

                                Gomia is in the coal mining belt. Only 1/4th of the total land area is cultivable.
                                Agriculture and coal are the major sources of livelihood for the original inhabitants
                                of the area. Employment in the Indian Explosives Limited is largely restricted to
                                people who have migrated here. The original inhabitants of the area, which was earlier
                                forested, were Santhali tribals. They got displaced when forests were cut, fields
                                carved out and factories and mines set up. Staple crops in the area are rice and
                                corn.</li>
                            <li class="default">Most land is owned now by <em>Yadavs, Telis and Kumhars</em>, while
                                <em>Santhalis</em> work as agricultural labourers, constructions workers and petty
                                coal business like selling small quantities of coal (usually illegally). Santhalis
                                keep goats, hens and pigs too; and brew rice beer. Oraons are more educated than
                                Santhalis, most have adopted Christianity and are economically better off. Non-tribals
                                include outcastes like Dushadh, Chamar, Ravidas; other caste groups are<em> Baniya</em>,
                                <em>Teli, Yadav, Kumhar, Lohar</em> etc.</li>
                            <li class="default">The jajmani system is prevalent, with the upper castes acting as
                                patrons of the lower castes in a complex network of duties and obligations. The
                                lower caste provide services (including that of midwifery) to the upper castes,
                                for which they are paid in various forms, on various occasions. The clients are
                                fixed, neither side can change allegiance. It is not a free market situation. A
                                particular <i>dai</i> will be associated with a particular family of `<em>Kisans</em>&apos;
                                (here, a generic term for the middle and upper castes i.e. the <em>jajmans</em>).
                                This is an obligatory relationship. In the jajmani system, there is security of
                                work and no conflict or competition as in a market. </li>
                            <li class="default">Overall there is a mixed economy. Market economy and market values
                                are entering the area, and men are more prone to break away from the <em>jajmani</em>
                                bonds. But women are by and large ensconced within these bonds, and have also in
                                fact taken over some labour that was traditionally men&apos;s, in agriculture. Income
                                from<em> jajmani </em>work is insufficient and families look for additional work
                                in the market. Agricultural work is available for only two months in a year, they
                                are paid 1.5 kg <i>dai</i>ly (i.e. Rs. 15-16). Construction work may fetch Rs 25-30
                                <i>dai</i>ly, and coal-selling up to Rs 50-100 per day.</li>
                            <li class="default">A number of illegal systems are in operation and have become a normal
                                way of life; these include -- illegal coal business; illegal liquor refineries;
                                illegal prostitution; illegal medical practices such as compounders injecting oxytocin.
                                Lots of middle-men have emerged, including petty contractors who act as a link between
                                coal sellers, policemen and coal mafia; and compounders, who act as a link between
                                <i>dais</i>, doctors and ANMs.</li>
                            <li class="default">Women bear the burden of household tasks (including fetching water
                                from long distances, in a situation of acute water shortage), as well as earning
                                a living. Men as well as women who go to the town or city to work have to walk long
                                distances from the villages -- as much as 8 to 10 kms one way. Buses seem an unnecessary
                                expense, they charge 3-4 Rs.</li>
                            <li class="default">Eating habits have changed, with less green leafy vegetables and
                                fruits like <em>mahua</em>, and more items bought from the (weekly) market such
                                as brinjals, tomatos, ladies finger, white peas and <em>besan</em>. </li>

                            <li class="default">Dowry is a problem. Educated boys ask for 20-25,000 Rs as dowry,
                                and lots is spent on pomp and show. Bigamy is still prevalent. Violence against
                                women -- wife-beating -- is a big problem in the colonies. It is worse in families
                                where men are employed in CCL or IEL -- have secure jobs. A number of men have abandoned
                                their wives.</li>
                            <li class="default">Festivals are celebrated round the year. `<em>Karma</em>&apos;&apos;

                                tree is worshipped, and women sing and dance. `<em>Jitya</em>&apos; is a festival
                                for the well-being of sons; and `<em>Teej&apos;</em> for husbands. Women fast on

                                are apprehensive about outsiders, and retain strong faith in traditional healers.

                            <li class="default"><strong>Khamra Basti</strong> is located near Gomia town, most men
                                from here work in CCL (Central Coalfields Ltd) and IEL. Some women are <i>dais</i>,
                                some agricultural labourers. It is a Harijan basti with pace houses. We saw some
                                young men playing cards, women said they are unemployed and therefore loiter around.
                                Local alcohol is brewed from mahua. Men from town come and drink, and also there

                                inhabitants buy coal illegally from the colliery, carry it home, sell it to contractors
                                at godowns or local consumers. There are a large number of <i>dais</i>. In all there
                                are about 100 <em>kacha</em> houses, they are big and open, with pits in separate
                                pig-houses. Here too there are water problems. The government has cut down local
                                forests and have planted protected forests, there is no land left even for use as
                                toilets. Most people have moved out to Khamra <em>basti</em> and the people are
                                afraid the area may be declared a coal mine area and they may all be displaced.

                            <li class="default">MJK and MS workers are called <em>sahayoginis</em>. They are a core
                                resource group. Each sahayogini holds weekly meetings in 10 fixed villages. She
                                shares information with the village women about training programmes, does surveys
                                on women&apos;s health, runs savings accounts, and supervises the educational centres.
                                The <em>sahayoginis</em> have a deep relationship with the women. </li>
                            <li class="default">There is no clear division between MJK and MS, but source of funds
                                and payment are different. The disparity in salary does not seem to be a source
                                of conflict. On the whole there is dissatisfaction with salaries, they are on the
                                low side. This is a reason for some tension in the organisation. </li>
                            <li class="default"><em>Sahayoginis </em>are extremely hard-working, and diligent. Each
                                bears a lot of responsibilities. The work is directed by Pilar. The workers are
                                well informed about their basic work i.e. violence against women.</li>
                            <li class="default">They are busy in their routine work and do not get much time to
                                follow up workshops like this one.</li>
                            <li class="default">After this workshop <em>sahayoginis</em> said it would be good if
                                they learnt birthing work. They developed a critique of the routinised medical practice
                                of giving injections and episiotomies. Some said they would like to learn from <i>dais</i>,
                                and assist them in childbirth. The <i>dais</i> would not like to share their jajmani
                                work, but may want to give over work in poor houses. </li>
                            <li class="default"><em>Sahayoginis</em> will share the knowledge that food should be
                                given to a woman after delivery (jaggery, black grams, chura, and tonics of <em>mahua</em>,
                                <em>anwala</em>, <em>berries</em> etc).</li>
