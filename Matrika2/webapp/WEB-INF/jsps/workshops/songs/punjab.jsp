            Marriage Songs from Punjab</p>
        <p class="smltxt4">
            The following songs are more like couplets or aphorisms&#8212;short and to the point
            rather than lengthy and discursive. They are sung at the women&#8217;s festivities
            at the time of marriage and reflect the social, cultural and familial realities
            of village Punjab.</p>
        <p class="smltxt4">
            The girl, who is now grown and ready for marriage, is compared to a radish, which
            is ready for breaking. Her parents fold their hands in obeisance to those better
            off, since they are poor. Reflects the practice of young men marrying down social
            hierarchies and women marrying up.</p>
        <p align="left" class="lrgtxt6">
            <em>The radish is long and long are its leaves
                <br />
                Poor people give their daughters [in marriage] and yet their hands are tied.</em></p>

            The frivolity and freedom of childhood will be exchanged for the convention of purdah,
            face covering and living on the &#8216;points of the needle&#8217; a poetic reference
            to both sexual intercourse and the pains of adjusting to life in the husband&#8217;s
            house.</p>
