                    <li class="default">The <i>dai</i> is called when the <i>Jacha</i> gives the signal
                        to her family <i>Saas</i>, Jethani or neighbour. Whatever time of day or night it
                        is, the <i>dai</i> comes to the <i>Jacha</i>&apos;s home.</li>
                    <li class="default">The <i>dai</i> may check the baby&apos;s heartbeat with her ear
                        to the <i>Jacha</i>&apos;s belly.</li>
                    <li class="default">The <i>dai</i> will check whether the head is fixed , <i>shareer
                        bhar gaya hai.</i></li>
                    <li class="default">She notes the position of the baby, confirms that it is normal,
                        <i>seedha</i> .</li>
                    <li class="default">In A.P. the <i>dai</i> pours castor oil on the navel, and if it
                        is full term it will flow to the end of the womb. Also, the size of the baby is
                        measured by placing hands on the upper and lower belly.</li>
                    <li class="default">If the contractions indicate early stage of labour, <i>kacha dard</i>,
                        the <i>dai</i> advises the woman to keep active by walking, doing light work. She
                        advises her to take contractions by holding onto a wall or a ledge.</li>
                    <li class="default">The <i>dai</i> may request that only one or two family members (or
                        elder woman of the neighbourhood) stay in the room, so that the work of birthing
                        can be done with concentration. No men can stay inside. </li>
                    <li class="default">She asks for water to be boiled, sterilises blade and thread.</li>
                    <li class="default">She keeps her attention on the <i>Jacha</i>, talking with her, joking,
                        reassuring her, asking questions and noting the progress of labour.</li>
                    <li class="default">If progress is slow, or the woman is weak or tired, then the <i>
                        dai</i> gives her a warm drink. This may be coriander warmed in <i>jaggery</i>;
                        or <i>ajwain </i>and ghee in milk.</li>
                    <li class="default">If progress is slow, the <i>dai</i> may apply light pressure on
                        the upper belly.</li>
                    <li class="default">She may place hair in the <i>Jacha</i>&apos;s mouth for gagging.</li>
                    <li class="default">All knots on the woman&apos;s clothing, her hair, any other knots
                        in the room are usually untied. In Rajasthan, all the locks and windows of the house
                        are opened, the <i>Jacha</i>&apos;s bangles are removed.</li>
                    <li class="default">In Rajasthan <i>aata</i> is kept in a <i>thaali</i> and cut in two
                        before the birth. The <i>Jacha</i> herself is asked to cut it, with a coin. It speeds
                        the birth, and symbolises the cutting of the umbilical cord.</li>
                    <li><span class="default">In Bihar, when the woman has contractions, two separate heaps
                        of grain are kept, one is for <i>Gau</i> Mata, the other for <i>hal</i>-<i>hal</i>o
                        Mata. The belief is that <i>Dharti</i> Ma will protect the child. [<i>Gau</i> means
                        cow, <i>hal</i> means plough, both terms associated with cultivation]

                <ol type="a">
                    <li class="default">When she observes that the woman is ready to deliver, the <i>dai</i>
                        asks her to squat on two bricks, or to lie down. The <i>dai</i> exercises her judgement
                        here. Traditionally, squatting is preferred, but if the woman is weak or is multigravidae
                        with a history of prolapsed uterus, it is better that she lie down for the birth.</li>
                    <li class="default">The <i>dai</i> massages the <i>Jacha</i>&apos;s perineum so that
                        it becomes maximally flexible.</li>
                    <li class="default">The <i>dai</i> and other attendant support the woman through the
                        birth. If the woman is squatting, then one attendant is at the back, providing pressure
                        at the lower back, and the <i>dai</i> sits in front: the woman may lean on her during
                        a contraction. </li>
                    <li class="default">No <i>dai</i> will tell a woman to push until and unless the contractions
                        are hard (<i>pukka dard</i>). </li>
                    <li class="default">When she finds the woman absolutely ready to deliver, she tells
                        her to push. Many <i>dais</i> relate that there are three <i>pukka dard</i>. During
                        the third, the baby is delivered.</li>
                    <li class="default">During birth, <i>dais</i> pray to <i>teeka </i>. The belief is that
                        when the time is ripe, <i>teeka </i>will send the baby, no sooner and no later.
                        It is <i>mukti </i>(liberation) for the baby, from the <i>nau maheene ka narak kund
                        </i>(nine months&apos; hell).</li>
                    <li class="default">Among Bengalis (according to the <i>dais</i> present, none of whom
                        was Bengali), it is common to receive the child from the back. The <i>Jacha</i>
                        is on all fours, and somebody is there at the back to take the baby. Somebody may
                        hold the stomach from the back. Some <i>dais</i> said in this position there is
                        pressure on the chest and this helps the child to move downwards.<br />

                <ol type="a">
                    <li class="default">The <i>dai</i> or another attendant cleans the mouth and throat
                        of baby, and the anal passage by inserting finger dipped in oil.</li>
                    <li class="default">The <i>dai</i> massages <i>Jacha</i> from stomach to pelvic area,
                        to facilitate placenta delivery.</li>
                    <li class="default">She may put a hair in the mouth to make the <i>Jacha</i> gag to
                        facilitate placenta delivery, or ash mixed in water is given to her to drink. </li>
                    <li class="default">The <i>Jacha</i> may be told to call out her mother or mother-in-law&apos;s
                        name.</li>
                    <li class="default">After removing placenta the cord is tied and cut. Most <i>dais</i>
                        do this, but some<i> Rajasthani dais</i> consider it a sin to cut the cord (a <i>paap</i>
                        that equals the killing of a 100 cows). One elderly <i>dai</i> at the workshop said
                        that though she has delivered many babies she has cut only 12 cords -- her own.
                        She has herself had 12 children. She always makes the <i>Jacha</i> cut her own cord.
                    </li>
                    <li class="default">If the <i>dai</i> cuts the cord, she donates something for the gods.</li>
                    <li class="default">Later, the <i>dai</i> buries the placenta and cord. In Bihar a boy&apos;s
                        placenta is buried under the bamboo bushes but that of a girl is thrown in the garbage
                        can. In Rajasthan the placenta of the first and second child is buried, but if there
                        is a third or fourth girl the placenta is thrown in the garbage so that a girl is
                        not born again. </li>
                    <li class="default">The <i>dai</i> ties the <i>Jacha</i>&apos;s stomach with a broad
                        cloth.</li>
                    <li class="default">The baby is bathed and wiped, dressed and may be placed next to
                        the mother at this point. The baby is usually given a lick of honey or <i>jaggery</i>,
                        and may or may not be placed at the breast immediately. <i>dais</i> in Delhi are
                        from various communities (Rajasthani, Punjabi, U.P., Bihari, Andhra etc), and so
                        are their clients. Often, the <i>dai</i> is from the same community, but not always.
                        If she is from a different community, she is sensitive to their customs and respects
                        their practices, for instance with regard to breast-feeding. In several communities,
                        the <i>Nanad </i>or another woman of the husband&apos;s family cleans the woman&apos;s
                        breast with <i>doob </i>grass and warm water, after this breastfeeding may start.</li>
                    <li class="default">The <i>Jacha</i> passes urine in a bed-pan.</li>
                    <li class="default">Her pelvic area is pushed firmly by the <em>dai, aidi dena</em>,
                        using the heel of her foot. This is done for some time every day for the next few
                        days.</li>
                    <li class="default">A pad of cloth may be placed inside to soak blood.</li>
                    <li class="default">The <i>Jacha</i> is told to cross her legs. For at least two days,
                        she should keep her legs crossed most of the time. She should not get up and walk
                        about or else gas would form. </li>
                    <li class="default">In some communities, the mother may be given milk and ghee soon
                        after birth. In Bihar, no food may be given, except <i>ajwain </i>, for 12 hours;
                        later milk with jeera and <i>jaggery</i> is given. Next day she is given <i>aata</i>
                        ka <em>halwa</em> (flour cooked in oil/ghee and sugar). No salt is given to her
                        until Chhatii day; on that day, different kinds of food are cooked and given to
                        her. In Rajasthan, no solid food made of grain is given for six days, but she is
                        given dry fruits and <i>ajwain </i>.</li>
                    <li class="default">For several days, there are special preparations for the mother.
                        These are different in different communities, with the objectives of providing nutrition,
                        helping the uterus to shrink and aiding milk production. Some examples are -- chutney
                        (fine paste of garlic, curry leaves and mustard seeds) with rice in A.P; a spoonful
                        of <i>ajwain </i>daily in Rajasthan, helps food digestion ; milk with ghee, <i>ajwain
                        </i>and <i>jaggery</i> etc.</li>
                    <li class="default">Mother and baby are massaged. There are differing massage practices.
                        In most places, the stomach is massaged gently and with the purpose of helping the
                        uterus move back into its original shape and place, and aid removal of blood from
                        the womb. The navel may be pressed to help settle the uterus. Some <i>dais</i> massage
                        the entire body. The legs may be massaged with force, because the woman&apos;s legs
                        tend to become weak after childbirth. Some <i>dais</i> massage only the head, (..&quot;because
                        if there is tension in the head, there is tension in the whole body, if there is
                        peace in the head there is peace in the whole body, if the head is cool, the whole
                        body is cool. After massage I tell the woman to lie quiet, talk to no one for a
                        while. I ask her what she wants to have. If she wants milk, I give her milk, if
                        she wants rice and <i>dal</i>, I give her rice and <i>dal</i>&quot;, Ram Pyari).
                        In A.P. the massage is with <i>arandi</i> oil.</li>
                    <li class="default">The mother is advised to rest as much as she can for about 40 days.
                    </li>
                    <li class="default">In Bihar, for 40 days the mother does not enter the <i>puja</i>
                        ghar, touch the gods or do any <i>puja</i>. She cannot touch utensils and lives
                        in a separate room. Nor is she allowed to rest or sit under a tree. Doors and windows
                        are closed in the evening. Such measures are to keep away any evil spirit which
                        may otherwise harm baby and mother.</li>
                    <li class="default"><i>Chhati </i>is performed a few days after birth. The mother is
                        bathed, dressed in new clothes, and taken to the water source for worship. Before
                        <i>Chhati </i>she is not allowed to touch household things or cook, after <i>Chhati
                        </i>she can. The<i> Rajasthani</i>custom is to make her sit outside the house on
                        a chauka (platform), and the pandit perform <i>puja</i> for mother and child; <i>Nanad
                        </i>puts <i>teeka </i>on the mother, and keeps cowdung cakes in the room where childbirth
                        took place; <i>Saas</i> and <i>Nanad </i>get new clothes. At <i>Chhati </i>, all
                        mud vessels in the household are broken and new ones brought in. In A.P. on the
                        10th day, <i>Chhati </i>is celebrated. Adolescent girls are called and the woman
                        is given green bangles, flowers and coconut. On the 40th day there is well worship,
                        the mother and baby are taken to the well by married women and bathed. The land
                        near the well is mopped with cow-dung and then five kinds of grain are sown there.
                        <em>Paan</em>, <em>supari</em>, <em>sindoor</em> are thrown in the well, then she
                        carries water from the well home. For 40 days she does not touch cold water. For
                        three months she has no physical contact with her husband. In Punjab, on<em> Chhati
                        </em>day the pandit is called to do <i>puja</i> and make the child&apos;s horoscope.
                        In Bihar, well-worship is done by throwing <em>sindoor</em> into the well.<br />

                <ol type="a">
                    <li class="default">Breech presentation is handled by the <i>dai</i>. She is able to
                        manually change the baby&apos;s position, through massage done slowly, skilfully
                        and very carefully, to the <i>seedha</i> position.</li>
                    <li class="default">A <em>terha</em> presentation is more difficult for her to handle.
                        Unless it changes to <i>seedha</i>, most <i>dais</i> advise the woman to go to a
                        doctor for the delivery. </li>
                    <li class="default">Delayed labour is handled by the various facilitation techniques
                        already described. If delay persists beyond 12 hours, most <i>dais</i> say they
                        get an injection put, or, if they are themselves trained and competent to do so,
                        they administer the injection themselves.</li>
                    <li class="default">Most <i>dais</i> have handled the birth of twins and are confident
                        about it.</li>
                    <li class="default">Some <i>dais</i> report birth of monster babies (tera toma ??)</li>
                    <li class="default">After birth, if the baby is synosed or hardly breathing, or even
                        seems stillborn, the placenta is used as a resuscitation device. The <i>dais</i>
                        report doing this by placing the placenta on a heated surface, a pan or fuel-cakes.
                        They report that life flows towards the baby in the majority of such cases. It is
                        only after this that they cut the cord.</li>
                    <li class="default">Post-partum haemorrhage is a source of great worry for the <i>dais</i>.
                        They recognise that this often occurs if the woman has delivered a third/fourth/fifth
                        girl. Most <i>dais</i> said they have therefore made a practice of never informing
                        the <i>Jacha</i> about the sex of the child immediately after it is born, be it
                        a boy or a girl. They are very keen on advice on handling post-partum haemorrhage.
                        They are well aware that if the woman is taken to hospital it may already be too
                        late.<br />

                <ol type="a">
                    <li class="default">Local names of body parts and physiological processes relating to
                        childbirth were accessed, amid a lot of giggling, bantering and teasing. From the
                        dynamics we understood a lot of <em>sharam</em> (shame) and taboos surround this
                        area, but at the same time there is subtle acknowledgement of hidden pleasure. Women&apos;s
                        body parts are invariably terms of abuse, used frequently by males. </li>
                    <li class="default"><i>dais</i> are specialists in this area, therefore, partake of
                        both the <em>sharam</em>, the pollution, and the pleasure associated with it. Once
                        inhibitions were crossed, the <i>dais</i> made sketches and clay models, and described
                        processes in local idiom. </li>
                    <li class="default">c) While some <i>dais</i> acknowledge the role of the woman&apos;s
                        egg in conception, some speak only of the male keeda (insect). In the womb is a
                        katori (bowl) wherein the baby begins to form.</li>
                    <li class="default">Some <em>nalis</em> in the pelvic area are important in descriptions
                        of pregnancy and birth. The <i>dais</i> describe more by doing than verbally, so
                        while massaging they could show</li>
                    <li class="default">different parts and processes. </li>
                    <li class="default">Also, during the workshop, a pregnant woman from the ashram needed
                        help, which the <i>dais</i> provided. She was approaching full term and feeling
                        extreme discomfort and exhaustion. Usha <i>dai</i> examined her, and treated by
                        vigorous kicking on the thighs and buttocks, which provided immediate relief. The
                        treatment had helped move the baby into a more comfortable position, and helped
                        the release of gas. Bala, the pregnant woman, experienced great relief.</li>
                    <li class="default">Speaking of breast- feeding, the eldest <i>dai</i>, 90 year old
                        Chhoti Devi, said a baby should learn how to suckle and if the mother is tired,
                        she immediately puts her, even now, to her own breast!</li>
                    <li class="default">One sub-group linked body parts closely to rituals. In Bihar the
                        breast is cleaned by the new mother before beginning breast- feeding, with her own
                        long hair -- analogous to Shiv Bhagwan&apos;s release of the Ganga from his hair.

                                in <i>teeka </i>. <i>teeka </i>makes clay figurines, babies. First, she makes it
                                the size of a grain, in three months it reaches the size of a fist. After three
                                months, body parts are moulded, and in four months life is blown into the figurine.[See

                        have all taken a formal <i>dai</i> training course, one month to one year long.
                        Most said they have learnt the work from traditional <i>dais</i>, and at the formal
                        course the only new skill learnt was how to administer injections. One had apprenticed
                        with a doctor for some years; another learnt from three different places. There
                        was a consensus that &quot;real learning has been from apprenticeship -- from observation
                        and experience; bookish learning has not been of use.&quot;</li>
                    <li class="default">The <i>dais</i> are aware of the higher status and legitimacy now
                        attached to the formal system, and try to align with it, primarily, so they retain
                        a foothold. Injections, registering the <i>Jacha</i>, registering the baby. Some
                        have extended their responsibilities to cover these areas. </li>
                    <li class="default">All <i>dais</i> exercise their discretion regarding complicated
                        cases. Most advise a woman with a breech presentation to deliver at a hospital.
                        Many <i>dais</i> have established some link with one or two public hospitals or
                        private clinics/doctors. They usually undertake to take the woman there. They are
                        sometimes able to provide her with speedy and appropriate medical attention. This
                        is almost always due to their personal contacts with a doctor/ clinic etc. <i>dais</i>
                        voiced the need for identity cards so that their professional status is recognised
                        and they can formally obtain speedy attention for the patients they bring in. </li>
                    <li class="default">Some <i>dais</i> have had a great deal of exposure to the medical
                        system, whether it be public hospitals or a private clinic/ doctor; and also the
                        RMPs. All are unanimous in their criticism of the following practices &#8211; no
                        one, family or <i>dai</i>, is allowed to accompany the <i>Jacha</i> during her delivery.
                    </li>
                    <li class="default">Injection is frequently administered during <i>kacha dard</i>, which
                        is extremely dangerous. </li>

                    <li class="default">The <i>dais</i> are almost uniformly low-caste and poor, though
                        the extent of poverty varies, from the<i> Rajasthani</i><i>dais</i> who break stones
                        for a living, to the relatively well-off upwardly mobile lower-middle-class &#8216;trained
                        <i>dai</i>&#8217;. </li>
                    <li class="default">As repositories of knowledge of the female body and being, traditional
                        <i>dais</i> command respect within their communities. They are accepted as wise,
                        and often referred to for various kinds of advice. Yet they are untouchable -- for
                        caste reasons, reinforced by the &#8216;dirty&#8217; and polluting nature of the
                        work they do. </li>
                    <li class="default"><i>dais</i> are beginning to recognise intense competition from
                        the formal medical system and the need to establish their status as professionals.
                        They are confident of their skills but keen to upgrade their knowledge. They are
                        keen to earn both respect and money for survival. </li>
                    <li class="default">The knowledge about birthing is not monopolised by dass. Among the
                        Bengalis in Jehangirpuri, women of the household conduct the deliveries and there
                        may be no specialised <i>dai</i> at all. In our sample at the workshop, one <i>dai</i>
                        had learnt the work from her mother; another from &#8216;nature&#8217; (observing
                        animals when she took them grazing as a young girl in her village...using her intelligence...also,
                        being the only one present, as a young woman, when a woman with whom she had gone
                        far into the forest to collect fuelwood, went into labour.); others learnt by apprenticing
                        with an older experienced <i>dai</i> in the neighbourhood.</li>
                    <li class="default">Most of the <i>dais</i> are illiterate, but the younger crop has
                        usually studied up to a few classes.</li>
                    <li class="default">The newer <i>dais</i> seem to sometimes take on cases before they
                        have learnt the skills thoroughly, and end up combining the traditional with the
                        modern, not always to advantage.</li>
                    <li class="default">The <i>dais</i> express enthusiasm for Action India&apos;s proposal
                        that they unionise in order to establish their status and credibility and struggle
                        collectively for improved conditions of work. This will be a long and complex process.
                        <i>dais</i> are independent women, not used to collective organising. (During initial
                        introductions, a <i>dai</i> Ram Pyari misunderstood the word &#8216;group&#8217;,
                        thinking it is guru-- this speaks of an underlying difference in their experiential
                        understanding. Typically, a <i>dai</i> learns her work from an older <i>dai</i>
                        whom she considers to be her guru.) </li>
                    <li class="default">Some <i>dais</i> are keen on good payment for their work, while
                        others do not feel the need. One or two of the oldest ones refuse to take any money
                        on grounds of the sanctity of the work (&quot;It is not I who delivers, it is God/<i>
                            teeka </i>. I only help. God has given me this gift. How can I charge money
                        for this? I have conducted so many deliveries but take no payment.&quot;) This being
                        the situation, Tara, one of the <i>dais</i> who has brought up children solely on
                        the income from her work as <i>dai</i>, notes that &quot;women who accept less money
                        spoil the market&quot;. However, even the most money-minded <i>dai</i> exercises
                        her discretion when it comes to payment, and takes less, or nothing, from a woman
                        who is very poor.

                    <li class="default">There is widespread belief in <i>teeka </i>, the &quot;old white-haired
                        woman who leans on her staff and lives underground and keeps making clay figurines,
                        which she throws up and around....It is she who decides precisely when a baby will
                        be born....&quot; Not only that, it is <i>teeka </i>(or <i>Bahimata</i>) who writes
                        the fate of the child on the forehead (for a boy) or back of the head (for a girl)
                        -- a fate which nobody can change. Once, <i>teeka </i>wrote for her own daughter,
                        that the girl would marry a Dom and also marry her own son. When the girl came to
                        know, she asked her mother to change the predictions, but <i>teeka </i>said that
                        even she was unable to wipe out whatever she had once written. Resentful, the girl
                        left home. Much later, she met a man on a horse who requested her hand in marriage.
                        She agreed, thinking of him as a Rajput. But one day, when she was living with him,
                        he was called to make an announcement for the birth of a son born to a<em> zamindar</em>.
                        It was only then that <i>teeka </i>&apos;s daughter realised that she had married
                        dom. By this time she was pregnant. She wanted to kill the child, but she could
                        not bring herself to do so. She delivered her child, wrapped it with her <i>chunni </i>
                        and left him in the river. banjaran found this child and brought him up. In this
                        village, <i>teeka </i>&apos;s daughter also happened to be working. The banjaran
                        asked her to marry her son. And she married him. On the day of <i>Rakhi</i>, the
                        banjaran told her daughter-in-law that she could open all the trunks except one.
                        But <i>teeka </i>&apos;s daughter opened the trunk she was told not to touch, and
                        found the <i>chunni </i>she had used for her child. She asked her mother-in-law
                        about it who told her the story of the child that God had sent to her in the <i>chunni
                        </i>. Thus the <i>teeka </i>&apos;s words came true.<i> teeka </i>cannot change
                        even her own daughter&apos;s fate.</li>
                    <li class="default">If a baby smiles, it is said <i>teeka </i>is making her smile, if
                        she says your mother is dead the child cries. </li>
                    <li class="default">A fifth girl child is born to a woman, the woman is worried but
                        the baby speaks and says she will not stay for long with her. The family had a lot
                        of debts. In the evening the money-lender came and asked them to vacate the house,
                        then the new-born girl speaks and says that there is some money in the house, and
                        directs where it is. So the debt is repaid and the family continues to live in the
                        house. Then the girl runs out and climbs a pipal tree, with red clothes on. People
                        come to her with their problems and she helps out. After a few days she just disappears.</li>
                    <li class="default">A number of songs were sung, including Sohars i.e songs specially
                        associated with birth. The <i>dais</i> are extremely lively, and quick to procure
                        a <i>dholak </i>(drum) and sing and dance. Even 90-year old Chhoti enjoys singing
                        and dancing, often solo. However, the major dance was by Ram Pyari who was vigorous,
                        with weird animal faces and movements, quick -- and this was mirrored by Janet from
                        Matrika, which Ram Pyari enjoyed thoroughly.

                <ol type="a">
                    <li class="default">Jehangirpuri and Sunder Nagri are resettlement colonies, which were
                        founded in the mid-&apos;70s, with the objective of &#8216;cleaning up&#8217; the
                        main city. A number of resettlement colonies were created, in which large numbers
                        of poorer people were provided with tiny plots of land at subsidised rates. Many
                        plots were granted in lieu of `voluntary sterilisations&apos;...! </li>
                    <li class="default">These are large colonies, with row upon row of tiny ramshackle houses.
                        Characteristically different communities live huddled together in certain rows and
                        blocks. </li>
                    <li class="default">Some communities still keep animals -- buffalos, pigs, goats etc.
                        so these can be seen crowded up in the narrow lanes and by-ways.</li>
                    <li class="default">There is no provision for latrines with each plot, rather community
                        latrines have been built after every few rows. These are typically in filthy condition,
                        due to a very high number of people per latrine. </li>
                    <li class="default">The number of people in Jehangirpuri is a few lakh. It is extremely
                        overcrowded. While some families are better off, with a salaried earner, and manage
                        to educate children through school, most are not so lucky. Large numbers of women
                        do small-time home-base piece-rate work -- sticking bindis, stitiching vests, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li class="default">Hygiene and sanitary conditions are deplorable. Sewers are often
                        full. Water is available for restricted hours, that too varies. Jehangirpuri has
                        been created on low-lying land and in the monsoons it often gets flooded as the
                        Jamuna waters rise.

                    <li class="default">Action India has been active in four resettlement colonies for over
                        two decades. In Jehangirpuri, Action India&apos;s interventions began soon after
                        the establishment of the colony. A number of community-based activities to improve
                        the health situation of the residents have been undertaken, through a small number
                        of full-time women health workers, and a larger number of women organised under
                        the rubric of `Sabla Sangh&apos;.</li>
                    <li class="default">At present, Action India&apos;s health programme here is active
                        in the area of fertility awareness, herbal medication, `Apni Rasoi&apos; which is
                        reinforcing the value of women&apos;s traditional knowledge regarding nutrition
                        and herbs.Violence against women is also tackled. A small-savings scheme is doing
                        very well. </li>
                    <li class="default">Action India has been keen to begin work with <i>dais</i> so the
                        Matrika workshops would help them gain a deeper understanding of the <i>dais</i>&apos;
                        work, and strengthen linkages. In June &apos;97 Action India had its first meeting
                        with <i>dais</i>, which went off very well. It is a tribute to the organisational
                        skills and ground-level credibility of the local Action India workers that they
                        were able to motivate 11 <i>dais</i> to come away for 3 whole days, for a workshop
                        wherein no money nor any degree were involved.</li>
                    <li class="default">In the first meeting itself, the idea of a union of <i>dais</i>
                        was floated and accepted enthusiastically.</li>
                    <li class="default">By the next meeting, the idea of a small-savings scheme was described
                        in detail, and the <i>dais</i> have been very enthusiastic about this.</li>
                    <li class="default">At the workshop, <i>dais</i> expressed liking the fact of having
                        met each-other, which had not happened before.</li>
                    <li class="default">The idea of setting up a Birthing Centre is extremely appealing
                        to the <i>dais</i>. </li>
                    <li class="default">Action India requested Matrika to provide material and assistance
                        for the &#8216;Birth&#8217; tent in their Health Melas , scheduled for September
                        &apos;97, and for filming the three<i> Rajasthani</i><i> dais</i>. Both of these
                        requests Matrika agreed to.</li>
                    <li class="default">Action India also expressed the need for information-cum-ideological
                        training sessions for themselves, the community-level workers, on the theme of childbirth.
                        Also, they requested training in Active Listening, to help them build up profiles
                        of women, also of <i>dais</i>.</li>

                    <li class="default">One of the aged<i> Rajasthani </i>midwives, Dhapo, said that traditionally
                        nobody will cut the umbilical cord, except the <i>Jacha</i> herself. This is because
                        the cutting of the cord is considered a <i>paap</i> (sin), since by this cutting,
                        the source of life is severed. Dhapo and others said that the cutting of the cord
                        is equal to the <i>paap</i> of killing a hundred cows. Even when the <i>Jacha</i>
                        herself cuts the cord it is a sin but far less severe.</li>
                    <li class="default">Whoever cuts the umbilical cord should make an offering to the deities.
                        If the mother has cut the cord, she must make an offering. <i>dais</i> always pay
                        obeisance and make an offering before they begin handling the delivery. </li>
