        About Us</h1>
    <i>Linking modern with traditional understanding and practice can be a despairing task&#8230;.
        At times, we just cannot do it. This may be because we see something wrong--anti-woman-in
        a tradition being followed with devotion by many women. Or, we may feel we do not
        know enough or anything at all about a set of practices and the belief system behind
        them. </i>

        MATRIKAS: The Group Mothers</h2>
    <div class="center">
        <img src="<c:url value="/images/group-mothers.jpg" />" width="450" height="217" /></div>
    <br />
    This name was chosen for the NGO stepping out of the bio-medical and public health
    model of birth&#8212;into the cultural and sacred and indigenous medical traditions.
    MATRIKA is an acronym for Motherhood and Traditional Resources, Information, Knowledge
    and Action. The word &#8216;matrika&#8217; is drawn from Indian traditions of image
    and text where it signifies the concept of the group mothers, semi-divine beings
    (and also semi-demonic! &#8212;in other words they could bless you or curse you.)
    <br />
    The Matrikas are
    <ul>
        <li>Often voluptuous figures, </li>
        <li>Usually seven or eight in number </li>
        <li>Accompanied with a crone or hag (old woman) </li>
        <li>Sometimes &#8216;theriomorphic&#8217; or a human body with animal head, or depicted
            with their vahan or vehicle </li>
        <li>Shown with an infant (but only one or two) </li>
        <li>Often with Ganesh </li>
        <li>Similar to the group yogini sculptural images</li>
    </ul>
    Interestingly this image/text does not insert motherhood in a patriarchal or patrilineal
    context. The females are not &#8216;spousified&#8217; or made the consorts or wives
    of Brahma, Shiva, Vishnu&#8212;and yet the mother identity is invoked.
    <h2>
        Origins</h2>
    MATRIKA had its origins in Janet Chawla&#8217;s experience in teaching natural childbirth
    classes in Delhi to middle and upperclass women. These women were not able to achieve
    the births they had prepared for because of the obstetrical overuse of drugs and
    surgery. And the fact that women&#8217;s basic physical, emotional, social, spiritual
    and personal needs were not met during their labours. Janet heard about dais from
    her friends active in women&#8217;s health in rural and slum areas and she began
    investigating and documenting women&#8217;s experiences and birth traditions 20
    years ago. <a name="ResearchProject"></a>
    <h2>
        The Research Project</h2>
    <h3>
        Funding</h3>
    With help from friends and health professionals Janet drew up a proposal and found
    start-up funding from Unicef and the Rockefeller Foundation. Canadian CIDA funded
    the major part of the research. UNFPA provided a small grant for the Report &#8220;Saroj&#8217;s
    Death&#8221;&#8212;our investigation into the causes of a maternal death in Gomia
    District, Bihar. Janet was a longstanding member of Sahaj, a health and development
    NGO based in Baroda, and they channeled the funds for the MATRIKA research.<br />
    <h3>
        Methodology</h3>
    MATRIKA&#8217;s methodology was to reverse the common TBA (Traditional Birth Attendant)
    training model by asking groups of dais to &#8216;train us&#8217; and answer the
    question &#8216;What does a woman need during pregnancy, labour and postpartum?&#8217;
    We did interviews, group discussions, role plays, sang birth songs, did body mapping.
    We relied heavily on the techniques of &#8220;active listening&#8221; and positive
    reinforcement. We documented dais&#8217; perceptions of their own strengths and
    problems, religious and social experiences, caste oppression and poverty, interactions
    with bio-medical facilities and dai trainings, and what factors compromise their
    communities&#8217; health.<br />
    <br />
    We were able to access and remain with this alien (to us) information because we
    decided that we must not follow the common approach of limiting ourselves to modern
    categories of health and medicine. We thought that we must be open other ways of
    facilitating birth, diagnosing and healing--to ritual practices, notions of deities
    and demons, bhut-pret (ghosts and spirits), and the nazar or evil eye. We attempted
    to let the data speak the categories rather than the categories shape the data.
    We now have ample data demonstrating a radically different understanding of the
    world and of bodily processes than that underlying modern medicine and public health.

    <h3>
        The Research Team</h3>
    Janet Chawla, Masters in Theology, childbirth educator, writer and researcher on
    indigenous birth and misuse of obstetrics, conceived of, found funding for, and
    directed the project.<br />
    <br />
    Deepti Priya Mehrotra, PhD in Political Science and post Doc in Philosophy, with
    a background in street theater, grassroots NGO work and feminism coordinated research
    and translation activities as well as facilitated workshops in Delhi.
    <br />
    <br />
    Madhu Aggrawal, PhD in Art History, had 18 years of experience in art and culture
    related projects. She facilitated workshops and documented them by note taking,
    photos and tape recordings. She is a native of Rajasthan, one of our project areas
    and was fluent in Marwari.<br />
    <br />
    Renuka Ramanujam, MPhil. Sociology, worked with Indian Social Institute organising
    domestic workers of tribal origin. She is fluent in Kota and is from Bihar, a MATRIKA
    project area. She did facilitation, documenting, transcribing and translating workshop
    data and personal interviews.
    <br />
    <br />
    Lola Mathai worked with CARE, UNICEF and Grail doing grassroots fieldwork. She did
    documenting, transcribing and translating workshop data as well as handling accounts.
    <br />
    <br />
    Sudha S. Marwah worked with Women&#8217;s Feature Service and Media Advocacy Group.
    She handled basic office administration: including accounts, email, and team co-ordination.
    <br />
    <br />
    Devaki Khanna has worked with the India magazine, PC Quest and Computers @ Home
    on the copy desk. She worked as a computer consultant.
    <br />
    <br />
    Anuradha Singh from NISTADS (national Institute of Service and Development) works
    on Traditional Systems of Medicine, particularly on Mother-Child health care. She
    consulted with us on dais practices and Ayurveda.<br />
    <h2>
        After Research&#8212;Advocacy</h2>
    After completing the research, the idea was &#8216;to operationalize&#8217; our
    findings. Ideally we would have moved on to help NGOs and others to understand,
    evaluate the skills of, and cooperate with local dais in their areas. However at
    the same time the global health establishments (WHO, Unicef, UNFPA) the Indian government,
    Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and funding agencies adopted and promoted
    the policy of &#8220;Skilled Attendance at Birth&#8221; and this policy excluded
    dais from being considered skilled&#8212;or even to be able to be trained to be
    skilled. Thus MATRIKA&#8217;s data was of little interest to those in the health
    sector, public or private. There was no market in maternal health or Safe Motherhood
    programs for our approach of building bridges between indigenous medicine and bio-medicine.<br />
    Nevertheless in 2002 MATRIKA Charitable Trust was registered. Trustees were Dr.
    Kanwarjit Singh Chawla, Dr. Leila Caleb Varkey and Ms. Vidya Rao. (see mission statement)<br />

    <h2>
        Matrika Activities 2002-2006</h2>
    MATRIKA collaborated with Sampurna Trust to support Chetanbai, an accomplished masseuse,
    healer and dai, to teach Sheela, Bhagwati, and Pushpa from August, 2003-December
    2005. The center in Dakshinpuri was operating as a clinic for basti residents from
    August 2003-June 2004 and they worked there as well as serving a more well off clientele.
    We documented the process and problems encountered in this transfer of massage and
    dai skills and knowledge.
    <br />
    <br />
    MATRIKA contracted with Magic Lantern to distribute our film &#8220;Born at Home&#8221;,
    as well as privately distributed the film and Janet&#8217;s edited collection &#8220;Birth
    and Birthgivers: the power behind the shame&#8221; and MATRIKA&#8217;s &#8220;Hearing
    Dais&#8217; Voices: Learning about Traditional Birth.&#8221;
    <br />
    <br />
    MATRIKA organized and presented the play &#8220;Birth&#8221; scripted by a New York
    playwright and based on her interviews of women on their experiences of giving birth.
    The play was amazingly relevant to the urban Indian situation in major hospitals.
    It was performed 1st and 2nd September to an appreciative audience. The 9 women
    performers, although amateurs, were excellent and enjoyed being part of the project.
    <br />
    <br />
    An Exhibition &#8220;Dharti Ma, Dai Ma: A Remix&#8221; created by MATRIKA was displayed
    at the Palm Court Gallery, Habitat Center, New Delhi, December 2004
    <br />
    <br />
    A Seminar, organized by MATRIKA Dharti ma, dai ma &#8211; indigenous birth knowledge
    as a cultural resource, December 2004 at the Habitat Center, New Delhi, was attended
    by NGOs, scholars, and public health professionals.

        The mission of MATRIKA Charitable Trust is</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The preservation of traditional Indian birth knowledge and skills and the promotion
            of the elderly dais, who hold this knowledge. They are cultural and medical resources
            who are fast disappearing. </li>
        <li>Build linkages between doctors and dais, utilizing Ayurveda as a tool to explain
            much of dais&#8217; practice. </li>
        <li>To question, criticize and provide alternatives to the overuse of medical interventions
            at birth. Caesarian rates of 80% at the best hospitals are unnecessary and cause
            untold suffering. Even the World Health states that rates over 20% are unnecessary
            and dangerous. </li>

    <h2>
        MATRIKA Charitable Trust Mission Statement</h2>
    <i><span class="smltxt2">(Recorded with the Registrar of Societies)</span></i>
    <br />
    MATRIKA&#8217;s goal is the linking of indigenous skills, attitudes, diagnostics
    and therapeutics with modern allopathic medicine&#8212;both in theory and in practice.
    Dais still handle the majority of childbirths on the Indian subcontinent. Linkages
    with indigenous body knowledge and practitioners are vital if Safe Motherhood and
    Reproductive Child Health Programs are to meet their goals of reduction of maternal-child
    mortality and morbidity.
    <h2>
        MATRIKA works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To bring forward the indigenous health knowledge of traditionally trained midwives,
            dais, into the mainstream of current health and healing efforts&#8212;putting these
            midwives back on the map as health care practitioners.</li>
        <li>To make visible the skills, knowledge and cultural framework of dais in order that
            their heritage and contributions be recognised and compensated.</li>
        <li>To promote the well being of mothers and children from all strata of society, but
            particularly the poor and marginalised.</li>
        <li>To contribute MATRIKA&#8217;s findings from three years of research to the development
            of caste, gender and class sensitive health care and training initiatives.</li>
        <li>To advocate caste, class and gender sensitive approaches in research, public health
            information, advocacy and health care facilities.</li>
        <li>To advance affordable, sustainable, culturally appropriate and safe approaches to
            maternal-child health.</li>
    </ul>
    MATRIKA is committed to a gender sensitive process involving resisting unequal power
    relations at every level: from the personal to the political; from family to governance;
    from local to global economic policy. This means recognising that poor, low caste
    and marginalised women also have rights their body knowledge, cultural forms, ritual
    and ethno-medical specialists and worldview. We strive to engage institutions of
    governance and health programs to empower marginalised women by listening to, and
    respecting their cultural orientations toward the female body and indigenous pregnancy,
    birth and postpartum knowledge. Dais are essential mediators in this process, as
    they are carriers of traditional knowledge and care-giving custom. We act as advocates--motivating
    health policy makers, GOI, funders, and NGOs to include the participation of dais
    in all government reproductive health initiatives as knowledgeable and competent
    resource people.
