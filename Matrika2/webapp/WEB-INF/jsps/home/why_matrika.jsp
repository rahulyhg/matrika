    Why MATRIKA?</h1>
    <matrika:video clip="/Clips/Clip9_DoctorsInfo.video" width="384" height="288"  />
<a href="AboutUs.html" >MATRIKA</a> is short for Motherhood and Traditional
Resources, Information, Knowledge and Action. It was a 3-year research project on
traditional Indian midwifery in collaboration with four NGOs in North India. We
came together to generate and analyze data gathered from workshops, role-plays,
interviews, folklore and songs.
<br />
<br />
Traditional meth are not being used today because of the widespread belief that
obstetrical (pharmaceutical, technological, surgical) methods are the best way to
make birth safe. The Government of India has a <a href="FAQ/PolicyMakers.html" >
    policy</a> of institutionalized birth for all&#8212;although institutions providing
quality care are not available for the majority of Indian women.
<br />
<br />
Global health establishments (World Health Organization, Unicef, and bilateral funding
agencies) have accepted the emphasis on &#8220;skilled attendance&#8221; at birth&#8212;meaning
bio-medically skilled (able to read and write and use pharmaceuticals) not indigenously
skilled. (able to read and write and use pharmaceuticals) not indigenously skilled.
<br />
<br />
<a href="AboutUs.html">MATRIKA</a> departed from the conventional Dai Training model.
We asked the dais to train us in their own ways of handling pregnancy, birth postpartum.
The MATRIKA perspective views women, specifically dais, as decision-makers within
a different cultural and socio-economic milieu. Birth traditions, however, are not
static and now unfortunately injections are replacing rituals.

            We interacted with dais, asking them to share with us their own ethno-medical knowledge.
            Skills sharing and capacity building efforts of conventional dai training are often
            limited because the trainers have little understanding of the cultural context-dais’
            mappings of the body and rituals, beliefs and attitudes.<br />

            Women&#8217;s reproductive health initiatives have often critiqued top-down, hierarchical
            medical-delivery systems. In India culturally appropriate, affordable and gender-sensitive
            perspectives can only be implemented when health care providers and trainers have
            an appreciation of existing local health knowledge and practice. Assumptions that
            dais and women are ignorant about their bodies, and superstitious in the rituals
            which surround pregnancy and birth, work as barriers to effective and sustainable
            learning.<br />
