    and birth traditions, and dais (traditional midwives).

    health&#8217; nationally and internationally. She is currently Director of MATRIKA,
    an NGO active in research and advocacy for humane and traditional birth practice.

    (Earth Mother: Midwife Mother) drawing upon MATRIKA research and Indian cultural
    imagery of the fertility of the female body and the earth. Habitat Visual Arts Gallery,
    New Delhi (November 2004) Film Co-produced the film &#8216;Born at Home&#8217; (Video.
    60 Minutes with English Subtitles) observes indigenous birth practices in parts
    of North India. Poised between social reality and the eternal mystery of childbearing,
    the film presents an intricate portrait of the dai (midwife) who is almost always
    a low-caste, poor woman. The dais methods are holistic, conceiving of childbirth,
    not as pathology but as continuation of organic life. Gender and class issues are
    juxtaposed with the filming of the miracle of an actual birth. Sublunar films, Sameera
    Jain director. Camera: Rita Banerjee, Editing: Monica Bhasin
