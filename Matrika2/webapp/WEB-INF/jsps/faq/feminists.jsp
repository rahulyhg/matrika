    <h2>
        Aren&#8217;t these traditions anti-woman?
    </h2>
    Most feminists agree that freedom of choice and reproductive rights should be a
    part of any women&#8217;s health agenda. However MATRIKA is concerned that this
    agenda does not include women&#8217;s right to choose &#8216;tradition&#8217; and
    indigenous healing and birthing modalities.
    <br />
    <br />
    While it is important to champion all women&#8217;s rights to access biomedical
    health services, it is also important that we do not de-skill ourselves as caretakers
    of our own and our families&#8217; health. For this reason we need to acknowledge
    and respect the valuable contributions of women&#8217;s indigenous health knowledge
    and practice. Whatever form it takes&#8212;in North India a grandmother makes a
    hot concoction of mulati and ginger; a dai gives a woman ajwain ka ladoo or pangiri
    postpartum&#8212;these healing practices are still in memory. They will be erased,
    however, if their valuable contributions are not acknowledged. Cultural resources
    are being discarded. The question is how do we take the best from both tradition
    and modern medicine?
    <br />
    <br />
    Indigenous health practices, which are often household-based, are still surviving,
    unsupported by state and biomedical establishments, due to their abiding relevance
    to local communities. Insufficient knowledge about indigenous medicines and their
    therapeutic capacities has led the women&#8217;s health movement to advocate for
    more hospital care, emergency services, more chemical medicines and contraceptives,
    disregarding the wealth of alternatives coming from traditions. It is important
    for all women to take charge of their own health and not be dependent on doctors
    or other health professionals. We should not lose our living heritage of herbs,
    massage and ritual practice&#8212;nor should we be denied access to good modern
    medical care.

        Generally speaking, women in India find more resonance in the AYUSH systems and
        local health traditions as compared to Allopathy. This is because of their pattern
        of social and cultural relationships, their power (or lack of it) within each system,
        and the way women relate to their bodies and to nature. Contrary to what most analysts
        have argued, it is probably not their powerlessness (economic weakness, poor educational
        status) that &quot;drives&quot; women (as it is said) to vaidyas or hakims. As regards
        mental and emotional health, too, there is more resonance. In the Allopathic view
        there is a sharp mind/body distinction or split, hence a dichotomy of mind and emotions.
        The male mind (supposedly not emotional) is seen as the standard &quot;sound mind&quot;,
        and so women's mental and emotional health issues tend to get discounted. But in
        the traditional views, in general found throughout India, a person's &quot;man&quot;
        (roughly translating as &quot;mind&quot; but located closer to the heart, in the
        upper chest) is a combination of both mental and emotional facets. This is not to
        say that women&#8217;s mental health issues are not neglected by practitioners of
        Ayurveda, Unani or Homeopathy. It is only to suggest that the AYUSH systems and
        local health traditions may provide relatively more space for women&#8217;s mental
        health issues to be addressed.</p>

    <h2>
        Why is there so much misinformation about dais and birth traditions?</h2>
    During British colonial times Western science and medicine were viewed as superior
    to Indian knowledge systems such as Ayurveda, Yoga, Tantra, etc. Also gender relations
    and the status of women in India were used as justifications for colonial rule.
    The following quotes come from Katherine Mayo in Mother India, (first published
    in 1925) a book which influenced the Indian elite of the time.
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Says Dr. N.N. Parakh, the Indian physician:</em>
    <br />
    <br />
    Ignorance and the purdah system have brought the women of India to the level of
    animals. They are unable to look after themselves, nor have they any will of their
    own. They are slaves to their masculine owners.
    <br />
    <br />
    Said that outstanding Swarajist leader Lala Lajpat Rai, in his Presidential address
    to the Hindu Mahasabha Conference held in Bombay in December, 1925:
    <br />
    <br />
    The great feature of present day Hindu life is passivity. &#8220;Let it be so&#8221;
    sums up all their psychology, individual and social. They have got into the habit
    of taking things lying down. They have imbibed this tendency and this psychology
    and this habit from their mothers&#8230;There is nothing so hateful as a quarrelsome,
    unnecessarily assertive, impudent, ill-mannered woman, but even if that were the
    only road which the Hindu woman must traverse in order to be an efficient, courageous,
    independent and physically fit mother, I would prefer it to the existing state of
    things.

    <h2>
        What about the idea that birth and menstruation are &#8216;dirty&#8217;?</h2>
    It is very tempting for modern women to stand outside of ideas of the &#8216;dirty&#8217;
    female body and critique them as archaic and misogynist. Considering the MATRIKA
    data and focusing a woman-centered eye on India&#8217;s extensive and ancient visual
    culture cautions us against doing so.<br />
    <br />
    Dais&#8217; voices suggest that this &#8216;dirt&#8217; correlates closely to the
    fertility of the earth and of the female body. So-called &#8216;pollution taboos&#8217;
    are related to this female fertility&#8212;where priests have radically separated
    the idea of the sacred from the reproductive potential of the female body. This
    is true of all the dominant religions: Judeo-Christian-Islamic and Brahmanical Hinduism.
    During menstruation and post-birth women are &#8216;unclean&#8217;. However the
    dai speaks with a very different voice than the pundit about this uncleanness. To
    her the placenta, the ultimate polluting substance in the shastra literature, is
    spoken of reverently. It is no coincidence that dais are mainly from low and outcaste
    communities. Both caste and gender are involved in concepts of the &#8216;dirty&#8217;.
    <br />

            dung) which is known to keep away insects.</span>
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    Despite the pejorative connotations, this concept has allowed for abiding female
    spaces and birth cultures. In the &#8216;male&#8217; or &#8216;dominant&#8217; view
    these female times are &#8216;filthy&#8217; or polluted, but they are also times
    when masculine, social and even familial demands on women are suspended. Both fertile
    women and fertile land must rest, in order to create the world anew. And traditionally
    older women guarded these spaces from any incursions&#8212;perhaps with the help
    of &#8216;demons&#8217; and nether forces!? Within this imagistic representation,
    the nature of female bodily energy is understood as &#8216;out of control&#8217;&#8212;women
    are presumed to be more emotional and have special physical needs at this time&#8212;so
    the usual social constraints are suspended. Of course we need to question the priestly
    voice and de-sacralisation of menstruation and birth&#8212;but we should not throw
    out the baby with the bathwater. We should not ignore traditional birth knowledge.

    <h2>
        How can we who are concerned about gender and the politics of knowledge understand
        the gender biases of modern medicine?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Science and modern knowledge systems were developed in 17th Century Europe among
            a group of elite men, outside of the Universities, that were controlled by the Church.
            They explicitly and implicitly excluded women for 300 years. (And also lower class
            men and men of color.)</li>
        <li>In England the Royal Society was founded in 1660 and the first woman was admitted
            in 1945.</li>
        <li>In the United States Smith College was founded in 1875 as the first educational
            institution which followed the same curriculum as men&#8217;s elite Ivy League colleges
            to which women had no access. At the time of its founding, the dean of the Harvard
            medical school published a book in which he argued that a rigorous intellectual
            curriculum would shrivel a woman&#8217;s uterus since all her blood would have to
            go to her brain. </li>
        <li>One characteristic of this system was that it depended on a new world view&#8212;one
            in which the non-human world was machine-like, had no consciousness or agency. God
            was understood to be the creator of the world, likened to a master clockmaker of
            an inert and unconscious universe. God wound up the clock and gave it its working
            rules, the &#8220;laws of nature&#8221;.</li>
        <li>Human beings (male) endowed with a God-like mind could figure out the rules&#8212;they
            are called the &#8216;laws of nature&#8217;.</li>
        <li>Spirit or soul was removed from nature&#8212;nature was inert and nature and culture
            were totally separate, becoming categories that are mutually exclusive in the sense
            that culture is what nature is not and nature is what culture is not.</li>
        <li>According to Boyd, the father of the scientific experimental method, God could create
            and annihilate but Nature could do neither. Thus experimental science was fully
            legitimated to act upon nature. Women could not participate in these experiments
            since women were equated with nature.</li>
        <li>These changes in worldview overlapped with the &#8216;Enclosure movement&#8217;&#8212;land
            being enclosed and privately owned. Before many people had rights to land. The European
            &#8216;commons&#8217; was the material foundation of peasant social life. Land became
            a &#8216;resource&#8217; and peasants were removed by the &#8216;owners&#8217;.
            Livelihoods, social life, sacredness of land were all eroded. </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>
        &#8220;The Age of Reason was Built on the Ashes of European Shamanesses&#8221;</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The emergence of this knowledge system corresponded with the witchhunts (most of
            whom were women) and the persecution of other &#8216;heretics&#8217;. In Europe
            these were bloody centuries, full of religious and class wars. There was a prominence
            of women in the peasant rebellions.</li>
        <li>In the German city of Cologne during the religious wars nearly all the midwives
            were executed. Women accused of witchcraft were often midwives and healers as well
            as shamanesses using local psychotropic plants. </li>
        <li>The wise women (in French Sage Fem, in Hindi Samajwali&#8212;she who knows) lived
            in local communities mostly practicing subsistence agriculture. They articulated
            the agency of the non-human world through expressions of gratitude, reciprocity,
            language of the spirit, as well as gift exchange.</li>
        <li>Nature&#8217;s powers of Regeneration were not separate from human regeneration.
            Psychotropic substances, communication with the dead, rituals all facilitated regeneration.</li>
        <li>In the earlier worldview there was a world soul, Anima Mundi, and all of matter
            was full of life. The world was full of God. The five elements (the panchmahabhuta)
            linked the human and non-human world.</font></li>
        <li>The shaman&#8212;plant&#8212;ritual&#8212;forest or jungle all co-created each other
            in this cosmovision.</li>
