            what the feeling of a baby's head stretching the perineal tissues 
            will be like and warning the mother about the pitfalls in pushing

          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
            woman will be receptive to conversations in prenatal visits about 
            the realities of the birth process. Following is what I convey about 
            second stage (pushing):</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. 
            When you begin to feel like pushing, it will be a bowel movement-like 
            feeling in your bum. We will not rush this part. You will tune into 
            your body and do the least bearing down possible. This will allow 
            your body to suffuse hormones to your perineum and make it very stretchy 
            by the time the baby's head is there.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. 
            The feeling in your bum will increase until it feels like you are 
            splitting in two and it's more than you can stand. This is normal, 
            and no one has ever split in two. Because you have been educated that 
            this is normal, you will relax and find this an interesting and weird 
            experience.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. 
            The next distinct feeling is a burning, pins-and-needles feeling at 
            the vaginal opening. Many women describe it as a &quot;ring of fire&quot; 
            all around the vaginal opening. It is instinctive to slap your hand 
            down on the now-bulging vulva and try to control where the baby's 
            head is starting to emerge. This instinct should be followed--it seems 
            to really help.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. 
            Most women like pushing more than dilating. When you're pushing you 
            feel like you're getting somewhere and that there really is a goal 
            for your efforts.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. 
            This is a time of great concentration and focus. Extraneous conversation 
            will not be allowed in the room. Everyone will be silent and respectful 
            in between sensations while you regather your focus. Once you begin 
            feeling the ring of fire, there is no need for hurry. You will be 
            guided to push as you feel like until the baby is crowning. All that 
            will be touching your tissues is a hot face cloth (if you wish) and 
            your own hands. It is important for the practitioner to keep her hands 
            off because the blood-filled tissues can be easily bruised and weakened 
            by poking, external fingers. This can lead to tearing. We will use 
            a mirror and a flashlight to see what's happening so we can guide 
            you. We won't touch you or the baby. </font> </p>
