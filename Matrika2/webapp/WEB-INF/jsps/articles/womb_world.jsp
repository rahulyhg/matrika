            This paper highlights gaps in knowledge both for mothers and midwives. 
            Mothers should be better informed how the biological specificity of 
            their early milk meets the changing needs of their babies. Midwives 
            should have a formal programme of education concerning the physiology 
            of normal metabolic changes from womb to world as well as the theoretical 
            framework that underpins biological strategy. It is urgent for educators 
            to address these gaps in knowledge.</font></p>

            and E. Kent Hospitals NHS Trust, CATCHTM aims to catch in a breastfeeding

          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Postnatal 
            transition from fetus to neonate is characterised by discontinuity. 
            Inevitably the neonate must change environment from the dark, warm, 
            wet, sheltered place in the womb to the colder, dry, bright, loud 
            conditions of the world; the umbilical cord is severed. Separation 
            and rupture are the watchwords. Well-known changes require thermal, 
            cardiovascular, pulmonary, vestibular, immune and metabolic adaptation.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cardiopulmonary, 
            immune and thermal adaptations are well documented in the medical 
            and midwifery textbooks. Successful metabolic adaptation is just as 
            critical to infant well-being. Yet, most midwifery and many pediatric 
            texts fail to describe the normal physiology of metabolic transition 
            from fetus to neonate. Instead, metabolic adaptation is discussed 
            in chapters devoted to hypoglycemia or in relation to disorders of 
            blood glucose homeostasis.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just 
            as neonatal heart rate, respirations and colour make cardiopulmonary 
            transition tangible for midwifery assessment, neonatal nutrition offers 
            a window into the assessment of metabolic adaptive processes. However, 
            many current practices hinder an understanding of the normal physiology:</font></p>

              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Metabolic 
                transition is not generally taught in midwifery and medical curricula 
                as part of normal postnatal adaptation from fetus to neonate. 
                Descriptions of metabolic changes are absent or sparse. When present, 
                they are usually rooted in pathology. </font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Research 
                has shown that patterns of metabolic adaptation are different 
                according to whether the baby is breastfed or has artificial feeds 
                (Hawdon et al., 1992; Del Rooy et al.,1998; Hawdon et al., 2000). 
                This is largely ignored in midwifery and pediatric assessment. 
                Mixed feeding is common in the first three days postnatal even 
                when the mother wants to breastfeed exclusively. </font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, 
                in the early postnatal days, current breastfeeding definitions 
                disregard dose. A baby is considered to be breastfed when receiving 
                any amount of mother's milk, however small. Not knowing whether 
                the baby is exclusively breastfed blurs the understanding of those 
                clinical characteristics associated with a baby who is wholly 
                breastfed. </font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mothers are 
                often encouraged to swaddle their babies from birth and to keep 
                them in the cot unless they are actively feeding. This practice 
                assumes that the continuity of maternal nutrition ends at birth 
                as in bottle-feeding. Immediate swaddling also accentuates the 
                discontinuity of postnatal transition, as mothers are physically 
                separated from their babies even when they are in the same room. 
                The early physical separation negates the continuity and postnatal 
                effectiveness of the maternal body to maintain a homeostatic neutral/thermal 
                environment from fetus to neonate. Keeping babies in the cot in 
                between feeds instead of holding them during the first three days 
                postpartum may have a negative effect upon early nurturing and 
                breastfeeding (Colson and Hawdon, 2002). </font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maternal 
                choice rather than physiology provides the framework that underpins 
                midwifery assessment. When there are breastfeeding problems in 
                the first three days postnatal, a bottle-feeding solution is often 
                offered. For example, when the baby is being demand breastfed 
                and is unsettled, it is often believed that mother's early colostral 
                milk is insufficient. Mothers are often told that they can give 
                the baby a bottle if they want. The irony is that maternal choice 
                then appears to motivate supplementation. One often sees written 
                in the notes &quot;baby unsettled, mother requested bottle.&quot;

            Breastfeeding </strong> </font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Research 
            demonstrates the biological specificity and the benefits of exclusive 
            breastfeeding from birth to six months postnatal (Inch, 1996; Lawrence, 
            1997; World Health Organization [WHO], 2001). Epidemiology reveals 
            short- and long-term health benefits for mother and baby associated 
            with breastfeeding (Inch, 1996; Lawrence, 1997). Many of these appear 
            to be dose related. For example, research has demonstrated associations 
            between increased respiratory and urinary tract infection, infantile 
            gastrointestinal illness, obesity, asthma, early-onset insulin-dependent 
            diabetes, and lower cognitive and acuitive functions with early introduction 
            of artificial formula (Lawrence, 1997). In view of these dose-related 
            benefits, it is surprising that more mothers do not wholly breastfeed 
            during the first three days postpartum. Conflict has been identified 
            between policies for breastfeeding and some of those to prevent neonatal 
            hypoglycemia (Dodds, 1996; Colson, 1997). The first policies require 
            that breastfed infants be given no food or drink other than mother's 
            milk. The latter policies stipulate supplementation, defined as pre-calculated 
            amounts of infant formula, to be given to healthy tiny infants and 
            healthy problem feeders even when breastfeeding is going well (Lucas, 
            1992; Dodds, 1996; Thureen et al.,1999). Supplementation in hospital 
            is strongly associated with decreased maternal confidence and decreased 
            rates of breastfeeding duration (Blomquist, et al., 1994; Dodds, 1996; 
            Foster et al., 1997).</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
            this article it is assumed that a diet composed exclusively of mother's 
            milk during the first three days postpartum is the fodder for the 
            physiology of metabolic transition from fetus to neonate. Exclusive 
            breastfeeding is defined as the suckling that both mother and baby 
            do together. This means baby ingests nothing but mother's milk. Recent 
            research has suggested that active suckling (as opposed to the baby 
            being the passive recipient of expressed breastmilk) may be a factor 
            that facilitates exclusive breastfeeding from birth (Colson and Hawdon, 
            2002). This differs slightly from current definitions of exclusive 
            breastfeeding. For a healthy term infant during the first three days 
            of life, active suckling and participation in feeding are deemed as 
            essential as an exclusive diet of mother's milk. There is a difference 
            between actively sucking at the breast and being cup/bottle fed mother's 
            milk. That does not deny the benefits of expressing milk for very 
            preterm infants, sick infants or any infant unable to breast-suckle. 
            For healthy babies who have suckling reflexes, it is preferable and 
            may make breastfeeding feel more natural when the baby is an active 
            participant.</font></p>

          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just 
            after birth, as soon as the umbilical cord ceases to pulsate, placental 
            circulation stops abruptly. This means that the constant supply of 
            maternal nutrition, and in particular, glucose transferred via the 
            placenta, ends. Neonatal blood glucose levels immediately fall in 
            almost all healthy infants (Srinivasan et al., 1986). The newborn 
            must adapt to intermittent feeding, digestion and intestinal absorption 
            of nutrients. Fetal life is dominated by insulin. Glucagon is mainly 
            switched off during fetal life. This results in insulin being used 
            as a growth hormone rather than as a metabolic regulator. At birth, 
            lipogenesis (formation and storage of fat in the form of adipose tissue) 
            and glycogenesis (formation and storage of glucose in the form of 
            glycogen in the liver, cardiac muscle and brain) are replaced by the 
            metabolic pathways of neonatal life. These are glycogenolysis (breakdown 
            of glycogen), lipolysis (breakdown of fats), gluconeogenesis (endogenous 
            glucose production) and ketogenesis (formation of ketone bodies). 
            These pathways imply a metabolic switch at birth from glucose to fat 
            and therefore a diet initially lower in carbohydrate and high in fats. 
            </font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
            pregnancy, the changes in maternal metabolic activity are specifically 
            designed to help maintain optimal fetal nutrition. The maternal body 
            builds, saves and stores. This means that the mother sends a constant 
            supply of sugar straight to her baby's blood via the placenta. The 
            baby therefore grows, saves and stores. Fetal life is characterised 
            by anabolism; the healthy term infant comes into the world &quot;well 
            fed.&quot; Healthy term babies are born with glycogen stores and chubby 
            baby fat stores to meet their needs in the first days while they are 
            finding and learning how to latch onto the source of their extra-uterine 
            food supply&#8212;the breast. </font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
            approximately the first three days of life, the healthy term baby 
            learns how to organise sucking, swallowing and breathing. After birth, 
            the mammary gland ensures a smooth transition and takes over from 
            the placenta to maintain a diet specific to the needs of the human 
            offspring. Early mother's colostral milk is high in medium and long 
            chain fatty acids and lower in carbohydrate. Research has shown that 
            the mean volume of early mother's colostral milk is 37 milliliters: 
            range 7 to 123 milliliters (Hartmann and Prosser, 1984; Hartmann, 
            1987). This physiological design corresponds to the baby's reduced 
            needs (on average equivalent to a little over an ounce during the 
            first 24 hours of life). A larger quantity forces the baby to glug 
            and may overwhelm the baby during the time needed to coordinate sucking, 
            swallowing and breathing. Early mother's colostral milk arrives in 
            drips and drops as the suckling finds the breast, latches on, organises 
            needs, latches off, sleeps and is breast-nurtured. Small amounts of 
            early mother's colostral milk are frequently ingested. This nourishes 
            the baby appropriately, maintains physiological blood glucose concentrations 
            and has a laxative effect to promote early evacuation of meconium. 
            Because a large amount of milk is not ejected, infants who are exclusively 
            breastfed in the first three days usually do not vomit. </font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
            striking point of continuity from fetus to neonate is that a mother's 
            body is apt and specifically designed to nurture her infant. At birth, 
            physiology suggests that the baby has a major change in fuel type. 
            Glucose supplied via the placenta is replaced by fat from early mother's 
            colostral milk and chubby baby fat stores. Early neonatal life is 
            characterised by catabolism. This catabolic state does not, as in 
            adult metabolism, imply pathology, but rather indicates a normal progression 
            of metabolic change. After birth, plasma insulin levels fall as the 
            Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis wakes up. There are rapid 
            surges of the stress hormones and pancreatic glucagon release (Hawdon 
            and Aynsley-Green, 1999). These hormonal changes trigger the release 
            of the enzymes required for the formation of energy fuels to meet 
            the particular needs of the neonate (i.e., to meet the initial requirement 
            of a diet high in fat and lower in carbohydrates). </font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
            successful metabolic adaptation involves intricate biochemical processes, 
            for a majority of healthy infants the transition from womb to world 
            progresses smoothly. However, recent fears concerning hypoglycemia 
            have resulted in early hospital practices that often require routine 
            admission to special care and supplementation with artificial milk 
            even when the mother wants to breastfeed exclusively. Along with supplementation, 
            admission to special care is associated with decreased maternal confidence 
            and decreased rates of breastfeeding duration (Hawdon, 1993).</font></p>

            is Neonatal Hypoglycemia?</strong> </font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ask 
            20 health professionals what is meant by neonatal hypoglycemia and 
            you will probably get 20 different answers. Simply put, hypoglycemia 
            means less than a &quot;normal amount&quot; of circulating blood glucose 
            (blood sugar) below which harm will occur. Under &quot;ordinary circumstances&quot; 
            the adult brain and central nervous system are obligate consumers 
            of glucose. Like hypothermia, hemorrhage-induced hypovolemia and hypoxia, 
            glucose deprivation, is a major stressor, a challenge to the homeostasis 
            of any mammal. Just like any of the above stressors, prolonged acute 
            hypoglycemia will result in brain damage or death. </font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
            remains complex is how to define &quot;ordinary conditions&quot; and 
            a &quot;normal amount&quot; of neonatal blood glucose concentration. 
            The normo-glycemia range in adults is 3.9 to 6.1 mmol/l (70&#8211;110 
            milligrams per deciliter). These numbers have been calculated statistically 
            using a blood glucose concentration of more than 2 standard deviations 
            above and below the mean for populations of well adults. A similar 
            glycemia index for neonates is problematic as regards definition, 
            significance and clinical management.</font></p>

          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
            is no medical consensus concerning the normo- to hypoglycemia cut-off 
            point. A review of 35 pediatric textbooks and a survey among 178 pediatricians 
            revealed a combined range of normal from less than 1 to 4 mmols/l 
            (Koh, 1988). More recent research has demonstrated normo-glycemia 
            concentrations from less than 1.5 to 6.2 mmols/l for healthy term 
            infants (Hawdon et al., 1992) and from 1.4 to 5.3 mmols/l (Hoseth 
            et al., 2000). Healthy breastfed infants have lower blood glucose 
            concentrations than infants who are fed artificial formula. (Hawdon 
            et al., 1992; Hawdon et al., 1992; Del Rooy, 1998; Hawdon et al., 
            2000). </font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
            research design of earlier studies often lacks scientific rigour. 
            Researchers examining neonatal hypoglycemia often fail to control 
            for feeding methods, and when they do, exclusive breastfeeding often 
            remains undefined. Furthermore, preterm babies are often grouped together 
            with healthy and/or sick infants regardless of gestational age (GA). 
            The actual age of the baby in days postnatal is rarely taken into 
            consideration. Recommendations for practice resulting from such studies 
            often extrapolate results for sick infants or younger GA groups who 
            are older in actual age to normal healthy term infants during the 
            first three days postnatal.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
            large retrospective observational study examined the effects of hypoglycemia 
            in a convenience subset of 661 preterm infants who weighed less than 
            1850 grams at birth and survived the first 48 hours (Lucas et al., 
            1988). No baby was exclusively breastfed. The findings of this seminal 
            study indicated that, in this group of sick, very low birth weight 
            babies, those who had blood sugar concentrations lower than 2.6 mmols/l 
            on five or more separate days had adverse neurological outcomes. Instead 
            of suggesting that these sick grossly preterm infants be closely supervised, 
            findings were extrapolated to healthy term infants during the first 
            three days postnatal. Recommendations for practice suggested that 
            neonatal blood glucose levels be routinely maintained at or greater 
            than 2.6 mmols/l for all babies from birth regardless of GA and health.

          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since 
            1988, 2.6 mmols/l has been a widely used definition of neonatal hypoglycemia. 
            This means that extrapolated data informs policy and practice in many 
            maternity units both in the UK and the United States. Because of these 
            recommendations, healthy babies are often screened (drawing blood

            accordingly. It would be as if the rationale supporting postnatal 
            maternal feeding policies were underpinned by research demonstrating 
            that some mothers who developed gestational diabetes had neurological 
            sequelae following successive episodes of postnatal hypoglycemia. 
            Suppose all mothers who declined to eat after birth were screened 
            for hypoglycemia and fed an artificial energy drink via naso-gastric

            to many different conditions. The non-specificity of clinical signs

            with artificial milk. However, giving bottles of artificial formula 
            does not always raise blood glucose concentrations. Recent research 
            has demonstrated that giving artificial formula feeds to supplement 
            or complement breastfeeds suppresses ketogenesis, in an inverse relationship 
            to the amount of artificial formula given (Hawdon et al., 2000). This 
            routine practice often disturbs breastfeeding. For the metabolically 
            compromised infant, exclusive bottle feeding may exacerbate the very 
            condition it sets out to treat. In the eyes of the physiologist, early 
            mother's colostral milk and artificial formula milk are not interchangeable!</font></p>

          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
            is no research concerning the length of time that mild hypoglycemia 
            is harmful for the healthy term neonate during the first three days 
            postnatal (Hawdon, 1999; Cornblath et al., 2000). However, a couple 
            of hours of low blood glucose concentrations appear to be physiological 
            following birth (Srinivasan et al., 1986). <br />
            Neonatal hypoglycemia has been called &quot;an ill-characterised clinical 
            entity&quot; (Williams, 1999). Williams points out that unreliable 
            bedside screening techniques aggravate the problem. Taken together 
            the findings highlight the futility of defining neonatal hypoglycemia 
            using numbers. Consultant neonatalogists such as Hawdon, Williams 
            and DeRooy and Cornblath et al., in the U.S., avoid rigid numerical 
            cut-off levels (Cornblath et al. 2000). Instead, they look at neonatal 
            glycemia on a continuum. The definition of neonatal hypoglycemia should 
            be &quot;the lowest concentration of glucose which in combination 
            with other metabolic fuels allows normal brain function&quot; (Aynsley-Green 
            and Hawdon, 1997). This will vary in a range of normal patterns during 
            postnatal transition and from one individual baby to another. During 
            the first three days, postnatal threats to the normo-glycaemia continuum 
            are cold stress (in particular), infant crying and any hospital practices 
            that interrupt frequent ingestion of the drips and drops of mother's 
            early colostral milk. Healthy infants for whom there are concerns 
            require a full clinical assessment of feeding and neonatal well-being 
            to rule out a wide range of pathologies, e.g., infection. A blood 
            glucose concentration in isolation offers very little diagnostic information. 
            Knowledge of the normal neurology and range of feeding patterns of 
            babies is essential.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An 
            operational definition of hypoglycemia is not a midwifery remit but 
            midwives are involved. As the guardians of the normal, they are responsible 
            for detecting any deviation from neonatal well-being as early as possible. 
            This requires advanced clinical assessment skills, an awareness of 
            the individuality of the neonatal metabolic profile and a basic understanding 
            of some elegant protective physiological mechanisms during the first 
            three days of neonatal life.</font></p>

            Neonatal Perspective</strong> </font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
            is common to regard infants as miniature carbon copies of adults. 
            Wheras, in fact, the opposite is probably true. From an evolutionary 
            perspective, what an animal is or does is governed by events that 
            have happened, not by events that are going to happen (Morgan, 1994). 
            The adult brain is an avid consumer of glucose. Findings from studies 
            on rats and human neonates where early diet was composed of exclusive 
            colostrom suggest that neonatal body economy may be regulated differently 
            from that of the adult (Widmaier,1990). Widmaier highlights that the 
            HPA axis of mammals is not fully functional throughout the mammalian 
            life cycle. During pregnancy and the first weeks of postnatal life, 
            the relatively dormant state of the HPA axis &quot;raises questions 
            of whether glucoprivation is a true neonatal stressor as the term 
            applies to the adult&quot; (Widmaier, 1990). For Widmaier, it is clear 
            that an understanding of the regulation of neonatal glucose homeostasis 
            in the first days postpartum goes hand in hand with an understanding 
            of the development of the HPA axis at the same period. Widmaier compares 
            the stress of hypoglycemia to hypoxia. In adult mammals hypoxia results 
            in a rapid predictable increase in the activity of the HPA axis. However, 
            hypoxia fails to elicit much of an increase in plasma ACTH or glucocorticoids 
            in neonatal rats. Although hypoxia is one of the most common and potentially 
            damaging stresses for the neonatal mammal, there is a relative neonatal 
            resistance to the effects of oxygen deprivation at least in the short 
            term. Faced with an hypoxic episode, Widmaier describes a unique neonatal 
            compensatory ability that is subsequently &quot;lost in the adult.&quot; 
            </font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Research 
            concerning human neonates demonstrates that the newborn infant relies 
            upon a number of mechanisms that may offer protection from the effects 
            of the physiological systemic glucopenia that commonly occurs during 
            the first days postnatal. These include intracerebral glycogen stores, 
            low glucose requirements, modulating cerebral blood flow and utilisation 
            of alternative fuels, such as lactate and ketone bodies (Hawdon, 1999). 
            </font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ketosis, 
            although usually pathological for adults, may reflect appropriate 
            and counter-regulatory neonatal physiological responses. The neonatal 
            rat is well equipped to utilise ketone bodies for energy even in the 
            fed state and ketone bodies begin to rise dramatically in neonatal 
            plasma within the first 24 hours after birth (Widmaier, 1990). Like 
            mother's colostrum, rat colostrum has a high fat content. Widmaier 
            asserts that it is not surprising that the neonatal brain would be 
            biochemically competent to make efficient use of this fuel source. 
            Hawdon et al. (1992) have characterised similar patterns of metabolic 
            adaptation in healthy term breastfed human neonates of appropriate 
            birthweight for gestational age. Their findings indicate that when 
            blood glucose concentrations are low, ketone body concentrations are 
            high. Ketone bodies result from the beta oxidation of fatty acids 
            utilising either body fat stores or fat from milk. Hawdon's research 
            on human neonates shows that ketone body concentrations peak on the 
            third day postnatal. This has been called suckling ketosis, and probably 
            provides an alternative cerebral fuel particularly well adapted to 
            the needs of the neonatal brain. Hawdon highlights that there is no 
            doubt that hypoglycaemic brain damage does occur, but the severity 
            and duration of low blood glucose levels required to cause harm varies 
            between subjects and is related to the ability of each baby to mount 
            a protective response (Hawdon et al., 1992). </font> </p>

            recent research evidence suggests that healthy but moderately preterm 
            infants (34 to 36 completed weeks' gestation) and healthy small/large 
            for gestational age infants generate ketone bodies like healthy term 
            infants when they are wholly breastfed (Hawdon et al., 1992; DeRooy, 
            1998; Hawdon et al., 2000). We found that the ability of these healthy 
            but vulnerable infants to generate ketone bodies was largely related 
            to breastfeeding/supplementation strategy. </font> </p>

            Regardless of feeding intention, mothers are encouraged to enjoy frequent 
            cuddling during the first hour following birth and during the first 
            three days postpartum. The strategy is called biological nurturing

          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under 
            physiological conditions, maternal and neonatal oxytocin is released 
            simultaneously stimulating metabolic and behavioural effects that 
            promote further maternal-neonatal contact (Uvnas-Moberg, 1996; Uvnas-Moberg 
            et al., 1998). When physical contact between mother and infant is 
            unrestricted following birth, peripheral concentrations of oxytocin 
            in the maternal circulation seem to be higher in the first hour than 
            immediately before birth (Nissen et al., 1996). At the same time, 
            in a protected and unhurried atmosphere, physiological beacons of 
            smell (Varendi et al., 1994; Righard, 1995) may light the way to the 
            breast. During the first days of extrauterine life, the newborn demonstrates 
            a few instinctive actions for finding and latching onto the breast 
            (Pryor, 1963; Odent , 1977; Widstrom et al., 1987). Mothers demonstrate 
            natural preference for holding their infants (DeChateau, 1987). Even 
            though certain labour ward practices may mask instinctive competence 
            (Righard, 1990), biologically it is the suckling baby who takes the 
            initiative in feeding. The baby's body on or closely wrapped around 
            the mother's body seems to trigger breastfeeding reflexes, while the 
            infant cues elicit maternal responses in a reciprocal manner (Colson 
            2000; Colson and Hawdon, 2002). The above is part of the theoretical 
            framework that underpins the concept of biological nurturing. Taken 
            together with some early evidence from the 1960s and 1970s (Winnicott, 
            1964; Brazelton 1973; Klaus and Kennell, 1976), the wealth of research 
            about Kangaroo Mothering Care (Anderson , 1989; Luddington-Hoe, 1993; 
            Anderson, 1999), and the physiology of metabolic transition, it becomes 
            clear that breastfeeding is a complex nurturing relationship.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
            research evidence illustrates two examples of continuity during postnatal 
            transition: continuity of maternal oxytocin and the maternal body 
            as a thermal and nurturing support for feeding. Research has demonstrated 
            an association between longer intervals between feeds and lower blood 
            glucose concentrations (Lucas et al., 1981; Hawdon et al., 1992). 
            Biological nurturing reduces these intervals. The frequency of active 
            feeding is usually increased with a decreased duration during the 
            first three days postnatal. </font> </p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of 
            course, it is impossible for mothers to hold their babies constantly. 
            When they take a break, father's arms provide warmth and security. 
            Many fathers say that biological nurturing is sheer joy and a lovely 
            way to get to know their baby.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
            practical as well as biological terms the nutritional, developmental 
            and emotional needs of the newborn infant are met through suckling 
            (McNabb and Colson, 2000). As early as 1954, Grantly Dick-Reed summarised 
            maternal biological capacity to meet neonatal need. He claimed that 
            breastfeeding satisfies neonatal needs for warmth, security and food. 
            These claims have always made good common sense. Research findings 
            now support common sense. Grounded in the continuity inherent in the 
            transition from fetus to neonate, biological nurturing is a &quot;back 
            to the future&quot; strategy that builds upon previous observations 
            (Reed, 1954; Winnicott, 1964; Montagu, 1971; Pryor, 1973). Biological 
            nurturing can help parents explore more traditional nurturing styles 
            and experience the joys of exclusive breastfeeding from birth. </font>
