	<h1>OXYTOCIN</h1>
	<h2>THE "CAREGIVING" HORMONE</h2>
	Researchers have found another parallel in sexual arousal during
	intercourse, birth and breastfeeding. A seldom-studied hormone,
	oxytocin--which we label the caregiving hormone--flows in a woman's body
	during all three stages. In intercourse, this hormone's release is
	triggered by orgasm; in labor, by the onset of contractions; and in
	breastfeeding, by each letdown of milk. <br />
	<br />
	Unlike many other hormones, oxytocin is generated in sporadic bursts
	rather than in a steady stream. With orgasm or milk letdown, an oxytocin
	burst can produce a euphoric sensation. Its release, however, is easily
	inhibited. Just as orgasm in lovemaking can be stopped by sudden noises,
	many a labor's progress has been halted by an inhibiting hospital
	environment. Nursing mothers sometimes report their milk letdown slowing
	or stopping when they're criticized, fatigued, or unhappy. <br />
	<br />
	<h3>PARALLELS BETWEEN THE BIRTH PROCESS AND INTERCOURSE</h3>
	During sex, women do not want their concentration disturbed, and in
	undrugged and uninhibited labor, their reaction is the same. Social
	inhibitions decrease as orgasm nears, and unmedicated labor progresses.
	The uterus rhythmically contracts, and a tense, almost tortured, look
	appears on the face. In both intercourse and labor, there's deep
	breathing, sensations of pressure and stretching, sighs, groans, and
	sometimes screams. <br />
	<br />

	out. It felt great to yell, but it freaked out the nurses and doctors.
	Lamaze teachers aren't supposed to 'lose control.' I didn't. It just
	felt right to yell, sort of a war cry." </i></div>

	Masters and Johnson data demonstrate that the uterine contractions in
	orgasm have the same recorded pattern as those of the first stage of
	labor--differing only in intensity. Caressing the breasts, in fact, can
	get a slowed labor going again by stimulating uterine contractions. <br />
	<br />
	When women are not fearful or anxious and have a supportive environment,
	passionate emotions are released and sensory perceptions are
	heightened--just as they are during intercourse. Regardless of how much
	pain is endured, once into the second stage of labor--the pushing
	stage--many women report pleasure. In the early 1980s, British
	researchers confirmed that women who give birth without anesthesia
	suffer more pain than anesthetized women do, but they also experience
	greater pleasure. <br />
	<br />
	As Northwestern University's Niles Newton, Ph.D. points out, pain and
	pleasure are not opposites. It's quite possible to experience intense
	pain and pleasure at the same time. Clearly, reactions to labor vary
	from woman to woman, pregnancy to pregnancy, and one woman's pleasure
	will be another's unrelenting pain. <br />
	<br />
	<div align="center"><i>"In my first birth I was literally
	screaming for something, but my doctor told me it was too late-- the
	baby would be born in 5 to 15 minutes. Bless his heart! The euphoria and
	high after that was something else. Better than after the best sex!" </i></div>

	<div align="center"><i>"I think you have too much emphasis on
	how pleasurable childbirth is without a proper balance of the reality of
	pain. I didn't find it so wonderful physically. Emotionally, yes, but
	physically sometimes it can be really hard and hurt."</i></div>

	Just as more sexual experience will enhance your physical capacity for
	sexual pleasure, pregnancy all by itself--regardless of what kind of
	labor and birth you had-- will do the same. M.J. Sherfey, M.D. reports
	that in all women, as long as obstetric damage doesn't intervene,
	pregnancy brings an increase in the volume of blood flow in the pelvis,
	enhances the capacity for sexual tension, and improves orgasmic
	intensity, frequency, and pleasure. <br />
	<br />
	<h3>THE NATURAL EROTICISM OF BREASTFEEDING</h3>
	The similarities between lovemaking and breastfeeding are also strong.
	During both, the uterus contracts, the nipples become erect, the breasts
	receive extensive stimulation, and the skin flushes. Soon after a baby
	is put to the breast, a letdown sensation brings the milk to the infant.
	While the hormone oxytocin is responsible for this milk-ejection reflex,
	nursing mothers don't usually have orgasms when their milk lets down,
	though some occasionally report they do. However, nearly all nursing
	moms describe a feeling of well-being. For a first-time mother, however,
	it may take a couple of months before she can recognize the letdown
	sensation. <br />
	<br />
	It is common for breast milk to leak from a mother during lovemaking.
	Some mothers then worry that there won't be enough milk for the baby's
	next feeding--but women find that there will be. While some couples find
	milk-filled breasts an added sexual pleasure, others don't. Of course,
	either reaction is normal. <br />
	<br />
	By the time your baby is three months old, he typically will have been
	put to the breast more than seven hundred times. For many women, this
	frequent contact enhances the response of their erogenous zones,
	especially if they occasionally nurse the baby skin to skin, unclothed.
	Breastfeeding's enhancement of your sexuality, however, may not be
	noticeable until after you have weaned the baby. <br />

	<h3>OTHER LINKS TO BIRTH PLEASURE</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Vulenrability</b>: This increases both physically and
		psychologically during pregnancy and birth, just as it does during sex
		in a mix of risk and trust. In pregnancy, it's likely you'll experience
		feelings from high spirits to low. Though you may be criticized for
		being "too emotional," these feelings are a necessary preparation for
		caregiving, because they make you feel more responsive to your baby and
		help you experience more pleasure in this role. As your pregnancy
		progresses, you look for calm reassurance and support from those who
		care for you as well. Many women, accustomed to managing their lives,
		are amazed by this need for support. Perhaps more than at any other
		time of your life, you now feel that you want someone to take care of
		you. <br />
		</li>
		<li><b>Need for Touching</b>: Researchers stress that the sexual
		pleasure derived from childbirth requires a calm, nurturing
		environment. An optimal birth is more than careful and caring hospital
		procedures and loving supporters, however. It's understanding the need
		to be touched during labor. <br />
		<br />
		Studies show that laboring women cope better with pain when there is
		constant support that includes touching. A laboring woman in pain might
		recover her equilibrium through a sympathetic hand on her arm, or a
		caress may blunt the stress of a contraction and give her new strength.
		Ensure that your vulnerability and need for touching will be met by
		loving supporters. Have not only your mate with you in labor, but a
		helping woman as well.<br />
		<li><b>Rewarding Brain Chemicals</b>: As in marathon races, birth
		requires enormous physical, mental and emotional energy. Labor, like a
		long race almost over, can cause excruciating pain, but our bodies
		offer a reward--brain chemicals--for this exertion. These chemicals,
		called endorphins or beta- endorphins, are narcotic-like pain killers
		that circulate in the bloodstream. These natural opiates are released
		by hard exercise, which can be, for example, vigorous walking, running,
		and cycling. Some researchers speculate that this chemical release
		explains the euphoria that joggers call "runner's high." The cramping
		pains of childbirth release endorphins, and the grimacing and grunting
		many women do, according to research with weight lifters, release
		endorphins as well.<br />

	Sexual feelings will vary in any woman, whether during pregnancy,
	childbirth or breastfeeding. In any case, it is important to broaden
	your knowledge about your sexual self, and expand your appreciation of
	your body. But remember that whatever you feel, whatever you want, is
	right for you.
