    <b>New Delhi: Shakti Books Series, 2006. 312 pp. Tables, notes, references, index. Rs
        495 (hardback).</b><br /><br /> Is hospital birth safer than home birth? Are episiotomy
    and pitocin injections routinely required at every birth? Are the globalised childbirth
    practices, now followed worldwide, oppressive? Should women’s rights include the
    right to choose indigenous health modalities, decisions about birth position, the
    setting for giving birth and choice of rituals and the right to avail of obstetrical
    services in case of an emergency during home birth?
    <br />
    <br />
    Thousands of pregnant women the world over contend with these and other questions,
    and yet, there are no cohesive answers to these issues, over which even adequate
    clarity is not available. The debate on hospital versus home birth rages and many
    women in the West today choose home births aided by a midwife. However, in India,
    as in most developing countries, birth is becoming increasingly institutionalised.
    In the latter context, where traditionally women have given birth at home aided
    by relatives, friends and neighbours, this shift to hospital births is occasionally
    resisted. However, few such voices find a platform; the lack of supporting literature
    within Indian anthropology on birth and birth practices may be partly responsible.<br />
    <br />
    Birth and Birthgivers seeks to address that gap. It amplifies voices not usually
    heard, of women from slums, villages and cities, who speak against birth in hospitals.
    The essays here question claims about the superiority of modern/globalised birth
    practices that negate tradition, mock at rituals and deride the knowledge of dais
    and argue that they may often be a veneer for Western neo-colonial agendas or the
    greed of pharmaceutical giants. Addressing these and other questions, Chawla and
    her diverse band of contributors reiterate the need to rely on alternatives childbirth
    practices that draw on indigenous approaches. Through personal experiences, research
    and fieldwork, the writers establish that particularly in India, a majority of women
    from the economically-weaker classes are reluctant to use health services because
    they perceive health care providers to be rude, patronising and insensitive to the
    life-context of the birthing woman. Though the overarching theme of the book is
    the traditional handling of childbearing, globalised birth practices and interventions
    are repeatedly questioned. Adopting a multi-dimensional approach, Indian childbirth
    and post-partum care practices are enumerated.<br />
    <br />
    Dais hold centre-stage in this volume, and through discussions with them, the essays
    seek to detail indigenous ways of facilitating birth through the use of rituals,
    herbs and massage techniques.<br>
    As a childbirth educator and an advocate for mother-friendly birth customs and practices,
    Chawla also speaks as someone interested in the reclamation of tradition in our
    contemporary world. She asserts that ‘most women’s and feminist scholarly writings
    on the body in India are focused on oppression and atrocities rather than pleasure
    and celebration’ and that ‘very little exists in praise of indigenous gender constructs’
    (pp. 25–26).<br />
    <br />
    Further she is incisive of the need for sharam (modesty/shame) and purdah to be
    recognised as special spaces inhabited by women, rather than being seen as the imposition
    of a brooding silence in the name of honour. For Chawla, limiting our understanding
    of sharam as a negative state is an example of sidelining the many positive aspects
    of constructions of gender found in religion and shaktism. Here, she also laments
    the growing suppression and abandonment of many of the customs and rituals associated
    with women, marriage, family, children and childbirth.<br />

    The second chapter by Rao provides some unusual insights into how pain is perceived
    and described by women. She examines sohars, songs expressing women’s experiences
    of pregnancy, the pain of childbirth or the inability to conceive. She details the
    ways in which women express or mask their desires through these songs, and highlights
    the complexity of the multi-layered relationships that women have with other women,
    men and their children. Moving away from analyses of the collective socio-cultural
    aspect, novelist and lecturer, Kapur writes about her personal birth experience
    in Chapter 3. She narrates her attempt to assert her independence, leading to her
    decision to deliver her fourth baby at home. Through her simple, often hilarious
    account, she questions the rationale behind routinely administered procedures such
    as episiotomy.<br />
    <br />
    Invoking her work with the Lok Swasthya Parampara Samvadhan Samiti, the fourth essay
    by Singh, an Ayurvedic scholar and philosopher by training, establishes that the
    traditional knowledge and its practice of dais are in consonance with the health
    systems of Ayurveda. While, traditionally birth was viewed as a social and sacred
    event and the female body as a microcosmic ‘workplace’ of cosmic creative forces,
    modernity has stripped the female body of such cosmic moorings. Singh recommends
    certified programmes with Ayurvedic inputs that will train and give legal status
    to dais as this would contribute significantly to maternal health care.<br />

    Citing NFHS sources in Chapter 5, Mehrotra, a social scientist and NGO activist,
    observes that nearly two-thirds of babies in India are delivered with the traditional
    midwifery skills of dais, passed on through apprenticeship and experience. Noting
    that culturally viable and trusted birth methods are being deliberately displaced,
    she shows that the existing public health system does not meet women’s rights to
    access safe and high-quality services. Advocating the reframing of universal rights,
    Mehrotra urges women to express solidarity and work across class and nationality
    to reclaim power in the arena of birth.<br />
    <br />
    Chapter 6 demonstrates the relation between caste and birth work. On the basis of
    extensive fieldwork in Uttar Pradesh, the author illustrates how notions of pollution
    define the role of birth workers; only the lowest castes handle cord-cutting and
    post-partum work. While the services these groups rendered allowed them to negotiate
    their position in society, she critiques contemporary health policies for attempting
    to do away with the ‘backward’ practices of dais. Done in the name of promoting
    institutionalized birth for all, this can only be seen as an irrational and shortsighted
    step, given the existing ground realities of poor public health services and scarcity
    of medical professionals in rural areas.<br />
    <br />
    Focusing on the economic aspect of birth work, Chapter 7 notes that dais view their
    work as their duty and an unpaid extension of their role in the domestic sphere.
    Armed with data from her fieldwork in Gujarat with the NGO, Sewa, Rai, first, argues
    that as the essential link between poor women in remote areas and an over-burdened
    health system, dais should be adequately compensated for their work. Further, she
    also suggests methodologies to compute the economic value of such work. The suppression
    of midwifery practices effectively removes decision making about birth away from
    women and shifts it to impersonal agencies, thus further disempowering women. Rai
    critiques state policies that marginalize the work of dais, thereby erasing their
    social contributions and denying obstetric care to a vast majority of poor women.<br />
    <br />
    In Chapter 8, alluding to the history of displacement of midwives and traditional
    practices from the birth arena in the West and in India, and based on her research
    in the slum area near the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, Sagar
    establishes that most women here preferred to deliver at home with support from
    their families and dais.<br />
    <br />
    Notwithstanding her training as a doctor and status as a lecturer at the Jawaharlal
    Nehru School of Community Medicine, she questions assumptions about the superiority
    of modern medicalised birth practices. Rather than linking poor health of women
    to the lack of a sound medical model, as policy makers and medical professionals
    are wont to do, Sagar argues that solutions can be found by providing quality back-up
    and social support for those who birth at home. Though mostly written in a scholarly
    style, the book remains readable and thought provoking. Providing a platform for
    voices of ordinary women that are not often heard within the public domain and probing
    many crucial conceptual and practical dichotomies such as tradition versus modernity,
    rituals versus science and dais versus doctors, the volume impressively interrogates
    the claims that the medicalisation of birth will necessarily secure universal birthing
    rights for all women.<br />
